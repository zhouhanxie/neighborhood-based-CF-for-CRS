0,"['Mystery', 'Marley', 'John Wick', 'Star Wars', 'series', 'Action', 'action', 'Knives Out', 'mix']"," I couldn't even finish I am legend because of the dog dying. Anything with animal death makes me ball like a baby. Hello! I'm more of an action movie or a good romance and mystery movie. It looks like a good movie for people who like many different movies. It also has a great cast! I was surprised to see Chris Evans in the trailer! I would definitely avoid that movie if animal deaths make you said. Oh that is so cute though! Oh I'd definitely would cry at the dogs death. It is really sad! the dog was a last gift from his dying wife which makes it so much worse Well that is another great action movie. I also recommend the John Wick series John Wick is a former member of a gang, he was basically an assassin. He falls in love and quits the game, but then his wife dies, and someone comes in and kills his dog. He then goes on a revenge rampage against the people who broke into his house. I have yet to watch the 3rd one but the action scenes were really cool! Daniel Craig and Jamie Lee Curtis are also in the cast. Daniel Craig does a lot of 007 so definitely a good hearthrob role to convince the misses lol! Marley & Me had me crying for a good half hour so I completely understand that! Yeah, he had to calm me down for about an hour and bought me ice cream to apologize for it. I just saw the trailer for Knives Out when I went to see Joker and it looked like a good mix of action and mystery! Maybe with Chris Evans in it it'll be easier to convince my fiance to see it. Do you know who else is in the cast? I avoided that movie because someone told me he passed away. My fiance took me to see jurrasic world as our first date and I cried at the dinosuars dying. The new Star Wars comes out in less than a month, if you are into the franchise. I haven't seen any of that series. Could you tell me what the general plot is> I seen that one too as I seen Joker about a month ago. I thought about asking my fiance about going and seeing it. Hi There! What types of movies do you like to watch? I am the misses lol. But he loves the bond movies so that should be a good incentive for him to go see it. Do you have any other recommendations? He is, I think he told me we're getting it when it comes out to add to our movie collection."
1,"['Terminator: Dark Fate', 'Terminator', 'The Avengers']"," I'm good! Kind of lazy on this Sunday I love back to the Future Do you like futuristic sci-fi movies? Good how are you?

Any other movie suggestions? The last comedy I saw was Christmas Vacation. How about Good Boys or Night School? Yes he's the main character. It makes the movie so much more funny"

Do you have a movie recommendation? lets see...I liked die hard, the avengers, john wick, highlander. Those kinds of movies. I also liked goodfellas, casino, the godfather Hi what recommendations do you have? No not really. I thought the first one was ok but not really up my alley. Do you have a preference for movies? I was never into the mob type movies, but I do like some action movies. Do you like movies that are inspired by true stories? I think I can find some trailers that might be good for that type of genre. What action movies do you like? Yes. I find it fascinating that farfetched things can happen to people and be made into movies."

9,"['Gemini Man', 'drama', 'Enemy of the State', 'thriller', 'Hustlers', 'comedy']"," My wife is actually right here, she said she wanted to watch your movie actually, so her and I are both going to watch it haha I think he has come a long way in this one, it is definitely worth watching I like thrillers and comedy mostly, and things with a good cinematography, though i Gotta be in the mood for it What movie do you recommend? A lot of it is laugh out loud, but it is also a make you want to see what happens next kind of movie. What's that about? And who's in it? Jennifer Lopez, Julia Stiles and Constance Wu It's about a group of former strippers who work together to turn the tables on their wall street clients Ooph I like Will Smith a lot too, not always the best guy for serious roles though, is it better than his last few serious movies? I think you will both enjoy it! There is another movie I am thinking of that is more of a thriller, it is called Gemini man Ahhhh interesting, is it like a laugh-out-loud comedy, or like a quiet chuckle? I have some good recommendations but I was wondering what genre you like enjoy the most? No I haven't, what's it about? If it's like Enemy of the State or I Am Legend I'll probably give it a watch, if it's like Hancock or that one After Earth I'll probably pass Well, I could probably get into that, I liked Jennifer Lopez in Enough Yeah, I think this is one of her better movies. Hi! I hope I can find a movie you would really like to see. It stars Will Smith and it is about a hit man who is being targeted for hit by a younger version of himself! It is very exciting! Have you seen the movie Hustlers yet? It is a little bit of a mix of comedy, drama and thriller. Who stars in it?"
10,['The Equalizer']," Have you watched any good movies lately? Well, hello there!"
11,"['Saving Private Ryan', 'Forrest Gump']"," Actually I was looking for a movie. Can you assist me by any chance? Its been a while but I did see The Post. I think it came out last year will do my best..do you like tom hanks? I like Tom Hanks a lot. Seems I recall that one, how about Forrest Gump What was the last movie of his did you see? Hello I am looking for a movie trailer to decide if I want to see the movie. Can you assist? I loved Forest Gump. That was a true classic and it never gets old."
12,"['The Shawshank Redemption', 'Old School', 'Will Ferrell', 'Daddy', 'Hustlers', 'Jack Reacher', 'Maid in Manhattan', 'Bird Box', 'action movies', 'Die Hard', 'thriller', 'Julia Roberts', 'John Wick', 'alternative', 'Tom Cruise']"," My Best Friends Wedding, Green Book, Die Hard, Shawshank Redemption I think I have heard of it but don't know the story. Based on what you said that would be a no. I am thinking more Mission Impossible or Money Train. I would love to see a remake or something similar to Notting Hill. Julia Roberts fan as well. Sounds great! You've got two great movies to check out is there any other movie genre you want recommendations on? Or any movie you really like and want to watch something similar? Hello how are you? That sounds cool. What is that about? Well speaking of Mission Impossible, there is a new one that recently came out last year and Jack Reacher is also a good alternative also starring Tom Cruise I love movies like that! The first thing that comes to mind is Maid in Manhattan have you seen that before? it's not Julia Roberts but its a pretty similar storyline My niece was JUST talking about that yesterday. She showed me a clip real quick and I am definitely going to check it out. Great choice, any other suggestions? Old School was so funny! Will Ferrell is hilarious have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2? It's about an army vet that investigates the mass killing of 5 random people in the same town by a sniper who has a weird history with him. It's one of those action movies where there are a lot of plot twists Definitely sounds cool. I will definitely take a look The spin-off is pretty loosely based off of the main movies so you could watch it and still be able to follow since it's mostly about fast cars and general action movie elements. What kind of comedy movies do you like besides My Best Friends Wedding? Are you into satire, anything animated? Hmm as far as thriller, have you seen Bird Box? That one seemed to have a lot of hype. It was not too scary but had a good amount of jump scares without the gore I am looking for something to watch, preferably action, comedy, or thriller if it is not too scary. I usually don't do traditional comedy but I have to say I LOVED Old School.! Will Ferrell is one of my favorites. I have seen it, Jennifer Lopez is awesome too. Critics do not give her enough credit. What is that new movie coming out of hers? The one where she is a stripper? Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies! Have you ever seen any of the Fast and Furios movies? They have a spin-off that came out this year called Hobbs and Shaw. Also, there is a new John Wick if you're looking for action movies similar to Die Hard. I have seen The Rock discussing it on some talk show a few weeks back. I don't know the franchise enough to know the storyline but I loved the fast and the furious. Horror films always scare me too. What kind of action and comedy movies do you like? Are you into action movies with explosions or adventure? And are you into rom/com's or more traditional comedy?"
13,"['Grand Theft Auto', 'Scarlett Johansson', 'Under the Skin', 'sci fi']"," i like the sci fi movies sounds is good A mysterious young woman seduces lonely men in the evening hours in Scotland. However, events lead her to begin a process of self-discovery. I'd say Opie and Anthony has better guests, but Ronnie B is a good egg. Under the skin. no Ron and Fez or Opie and Anthony I'd say so. its a web series on amazon the pop music feel like good but i think watch both movie what would you say? yes i like to watch Cheeky Ron and Fez or Opie and Anthony? I'd recommend dancer in the dark then. It's a friendly musical starring Bjork. what is this movie ? It's honestly not bad if you like Lars Von Trier movies. Sounds like watching? i like pop music are you recommend me How do you feel about Scarlett Johansson? Under the skin is a pretty eerie sci fi movie. Scarjo gets nay nay. yes i like too yes i like to watch this movie What's your favorite genre to watch lately?"

Yes, I have watched the first three, very awesome collection of movies. Is there i new one? How about the new Rambo? I would like to see trailers for action movies. Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? Have you seen The Matrix?

No, the fourth one will not be released until 2022 unfortunately"
15,"['Joaquin Phoenix', 'Toy Story 4', 'Robert De Niro', 'The Irishman', 'Joker']"," That's what I heard, I really enjoyed Heath Ledger's performance of the joker before is Joaquin's performance comparable? Thak you, I'd really like to see that movie now. That sounds very interesting and I like movies based on true stories, especially with a great actor like Robert De Niro. Very nice, I am glad I could help. Thanks for your recommendation of the Joker. I'd like to see that movie. First, what are your movie interests? Thank you...do you have a recommendation? I think what makes both of them so good is that they are shown with very different characteristics and do it very well. In this movie with Joaquin we have an origin story that keeps your attention. Id like to offer you this trailer. I've been wanting to see the Joker but haven't yet. Oh, that's good it's on Netflix, I'll have to look for that. I was really impressed with Joker, The Irishman, or for something a little lighter I recommend Toy Story 4. It is a really interesting movie and Joaquin Phoenix rendition of the Joker is very captivating. I like many movie genres, like romance, comedies, suspense, and thrillers. Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer It is based on a true story regarding the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. The main character played by Robert De Niro is Frank Sheeran and he was mob hitman the became good friends with Hoffa. Yes this was just released on Netflix just last week but it is a long move, 3.5 hours long. In both these movies I do predict that they will be well represented during award season. What is the Irsihman movie about?"
16,"['Frozen II', 'Power', 'The Addams Family', 'animated']"," Yeah, it was a pretty powerful movie with a powerful message. Did you see the first one? Addams Family was bad i watched the animated movies and is very interested Okay. Thanks Yeah i saw it Like what? I just saw Frozen 2, I liked it Hi, Yeah Very motivated and awesome Personally, I would recommend watching it on DVD when it comes out. Because children in the theater aren't always well-behaved Frozen 2? i love power Well then I think you'd like this one, it's way better than any other animated movies out around this time. Like Addams Family was bad What did you think of it? That's great, I entirely recommend Frozen 2 for you to watch then. Well then you'll probably like the sequel, do you like animated movies? Lol... You right. but i will love to tell you to watch power too very interesting Yeah i do watch animated sometime Hello! Seen anything good lately?"
17,"['Misconduct', 'Marshall']"," Something like Pelicans Brief Misconduct was release in 2016 have you heard of this movie No I haven't whose in it Is there any that are more current do you like old movies or something more current? Felicity Jones or Dan Stevens I am fine and you? I am looking for a movie about court trials hello howare you today Any preference on the rating? Josh Duhamel, Anthony Hopkins, Al Pacino, Alice Eve Something more current within maybe 5 years Is there a certain actor that youlike? The Lincoln Lawyer other than Pelicans Brief is there any other court trials movies that you have seen?"
18,"['Home', 'Ice Age', 'Over the Hedge']"," Both are favorites of mine! I really loved Home. It's about an alien, a girl, and her cat, and their adventure to rescue her mom. It's hilarious. Is that something that might interest you? A good comedy or animated movie. What kind of movies do you like to watch? It does, I've already seen it, Skritch steals the show! Maybe. I like animated ones like Angry Birds. Angry Birds was pretty funny. What about Ice Age? I think it has a similar type of humor. What movie do you recommend? Hello! I'd love to help you find a movie trailer to watch."
19,"['Playmobil: The Movie', 'A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood']"," Do you have a particular genre in mind? Horror, comedy, etc... I am married and have two kids ages 2 and 4 so of course I was wondering what would be suitable out there for them Hey, what's up my friend? Yeah, me too. He was a very interesting guy. Seeing the film might make the kids get into him. Thank you for your recommendation. I will choose Mr Rogers Well, you've come to the right person. When you have a GF, you tend to see a lot of movies. It abourt the building toy, Playmobil. Its made for kids so its only an hour and a half too. Oh nice. What is that one about? Well, the obvious choice is A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. It's about Mr. Rogers. Its an hour and a half, so it should hit your sweet spot. That is true. I think Tom hanks will do a good job in that one For animation there is Playmobil: The Movie Hi I am looking for a movie recommendation You can't go wrong with either one. I would probably recommend the first one, but that's from an adult perspective. Unless the kids are into Mr Rogers, Playumobil should hit the spot for them best. It would be a like atleast 1.5-2 hour max and a kids movie rated g Yeah. If you like Hanks and want something for the kids thats not too long, then this is the one. Reviews were great too. That is a good recommendation. You know how kids are my concern was making sure they were interested in the movie because it can be hard to sit through one I remember Mr rogers when I was a kid it would be nice to share that with my kids Do we know how long that movie is That would be good. Do you have any ideas on what other movies are around that amount of time and are animated?"

21,['Now You See Me']," I love watching movies. How about you? Ok, Then you probably have really good recommendations. As a matter of fact I do. What movies have you seen lately by the way?

23,"['Aguirre, the Wrath of God', 'Amazon', 'documentary', 'period', 'director', 'perfectly', 'documentaries', 'Shoah']"," Well, even though I'm young in age, I do think older documentaries are still the best that has been done. Even though I would not classify this documentary as fun in a joyful manner, it is informative about a serious topic, the Holocuast. The documentary is called Shoah. I usually like documentary films, or at least historically accurate drama films! How about earlier movies about earlier periods like the 1500s? Hi, I am here to help you look for movie trailer! That doesn't sound bad, I just watched the Ken Burns PBS documentary, which is 10+ hours I believe. I really enjoyed it. Have you watched any of his documentaries? I'm not very familiar with that time period unfortunately. I know a little bit about some of the explorers but that's about it. Any recommendations? I'm going to start broadly--what kind of movies you like? A general documentary about how the whole process of genocide against European Jews was carried. The unique thing about it is that it does not rely on a single piece of film from the 1930s or 1940s. The director, a French man travels to different parts of Europe, including the sites where the concentration camps once stood, and interviews the bystanders that saw their neighbors being removed. He also includes the input of prominent historians. That's too bad. I really enjoyed his Vietnam documentary because he did a good job of interviewing all sides and not just Americans. But his Civil War documentary was more focused on telling interesting anecdotes than the history it seemed like. Interesting, not very many people that I know like those sort of films, but I do. Unfortunately no, I had not even heard of it. As you mentioned liking historically accurate, I do enjoy those as well. Although they might not be presented from the viewpoint of an important figure, they usually revolve around a important event like The Biggest Short with Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell and Christian Bale. It presents a point of view about what led to the 2008 economic crash. That's great, I love documentaries! It's fun to learn and be entertained at the same time. What's your favorite? No, not really and the reason being that I read what some historians had to say about his Civil War documentary and it did not sound encouraging for my taste. Although I forgot to mention a very important fact about the documentary that deters people from watching, It has to be seen on different sittings because it runs close to 9.5 hours, which I think reflects the seriousness of the subject is addressing. That sounds very difficult to watch but interesting. Is it about a specific person who lived through the Holocaust, or a more general documentary? I did enjoy the Biggest Short. I enjoy Revolutionary War ere history but haven't found any great documentaries on that yet. John Adams miniseries on HBO was pretty good for a drama though. hello! I'm not much of a film buff, but always happy to check out some films from before my time that I may have overlooked! Another good one that the critics also seem to like is Hoop Dreams, have you seen that? That sounds really interesting! One would have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it I imagine, but the interviews sound fascinating and disturbing. Thanks for the info, I accept your recommendation! Well, I think my fits perfectly your movie preferences. It is subtitled, obviously, but as a film buff I do check lists that come out in which critics rank their favorite movies and Shoah consistently ranks as one of the best, if not the best, documentary of all time."

27,"['John Carter', 'Terminator', 'Avatar', 'Terminator: Dark Fate', 'Arnold']"," Such suspense. I'll definitely give it a watch. As long as it doesn't have Daenerys in it I think it will be a good one. My name is Jaime, nice to meet you. I like a variety of movies, but most recently I've enjoyed action or comedy James Cameron is a good one to have do it too. He is usually pretty spot on with the graphics and effects. Ugh Avatar is a sore spot in movie history. Visually beautiful, but that was the longest painful watch no same Arnold, just older... tell you secret they even got the original John Connor back that is the big twist... can't spoil it i have seen it, and it is not a remake, it is a direct sequel to T2 hi my nameis matt, i hear you would like to see a movie, any genre in particular you are interested Thanks for the recommendation :) I like your style cool, talking about action have you seen the latest trailer for Terminator, they finally got James Cameron back along with Linda Hammilton back to the franchise You have me sold already. Did the trailer show how they were going to continue from the original? i appreciate that, i enjoy movies, specially if they dont suck, and this last Terminator definatly doesn't. it only took 20 years to make a good one again I haven't seen that trailor, Linda Hamilton is great. I'm always hesitant with remakes though. Have you seen it? i agree, after avatar i did not think he would come back to the franchise but he did, i feel like he saw what they were doing and had enough lol, she is not in it. movie is good, way better that Terminator Genesys Oh thats cool. Did they replace Arnold?"
28,"['Michael Douglas', 'The Game', '13 Sins']"," What was your favorite part of the movie? So, you like movies with plot twists? that's awesome. I will check the movie out! Got it I recommend the movie The Game starring Michael Douglas It has not one, but many different plot twists. Is there anything else that you enjoy about The Game? Ok great, why do you think so? Hi buddy. What is the last movie you watched? I do, I do not enjoy movies where I can guess the endings Hi! I recently watched once upon a time in hollywood I really enjoyed the character development and the idea that the entire time I thought I would know the ending as it followed the Manson murders, but it had a plot twist!"
29,"['dramedy', 'moving', 'drama comedy', 'Midler', 'Dixie', 'The Boys', 'Sparks', 'Eddie', 'Troops']"," I like stand up comedy as well, but I prefer it to not have a lot of profanity or explicit content. I love action comedies and romantic comedies. Same stipulations though. Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies? Ha! You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler. I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites. Midler and Hawn make an excellent team! I had to google James Caan. Ha! I like both of them a lot. I have yet to see a movie featuring Bette Midler that I did not enjoy. I have yet to watch that movie. I remember seeing the trailer for it all the time when I watched an old VHS of A Very Brady Sequel, but I have yet to actually see it. That does sound pretty perfect! Hmm....well lets try to narrow that down a bit. There are all kinds of different comedies and some people prefer a certain kind. I, for one, am a fan of stand up. But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies. Which one would you be more open to seeing? That's pretty much it. I also like movies based around World War II. Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily. Do you have any recommendations for those genres? Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you. There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler! Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then! It's good for the soul. Its a painless way to release pent up emotions. At least that's what I tell myself. Well the anticipation is killing me! Ha! So what is the movie? Oh my. So you already HAD the tissues on hand! Well it's a good thing then cause I know for a fact this movie has squeezed some tears out of me, no matter how great of a mood I was in when I started watching it. Hi! Is there a particular genre of movie you're interested in? I might have a title or two. You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen! How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan? The movie is called 'For the Boys', and I really do think you'll like it, if not love it. Its moving and touching in all the right ways! Well that sounds like a dream. Can you tell me a little about the plot? I like to have at least a little information to mentally and emotionally prepare myself. I thought so! Its one of my favorites. Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991. Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy. I appreciate that warning. I am definitely a crier! Haha! I normally love comedies. I would think you right since I tell myself the same thing and I'm a Social Work major in college.;)"
30,['Captain Phillips'], What would be your favorite movie of his? I really like suspense thrillers that have some historical reference like The DaVinci Code I like Tom Hanks a lot Like horror thrillers or more just suspense? What kind of movies do you like? Definitely The DaVinci Code Interesting. Do you have a favorite actor/actress? I really enjoy watching thrillers and intellectually engaging movies
31,"['Weird Science', 'Foxy Brown', 'Speed', 'Eddie Murphy', 'Dumb and Dumber', 'Bird Box', 'Coming to America', 'Miss Congeniality']"," I saw it a long time ago. Definitely leans more toward the goofy vs clever dialog though. So not really a good fit for me. I saw Dumb and Dumber but was there a part 2? I don't think that I have seen it! Do you mean Speed? I know she does other things too, but Im looking for a comedy. I often think about a classic movie Weird Science. What do you think of that one? Yes I meant Speed It has been along time since have seen that movie but Bird Box and Miss Congeniality was also some of my favorites. I mean clever as in well written dialog vs. something that relies on slapstick. So more When Harry Met Sally and less Dumb and Dumber. I like comedians too, but I don't think of comedy movies and comedians in the same category exactly. Again, I like clever comedy much more so than just comedy that relies on shock value. when you say clever comedies are you referencing to ones like to the tonight show? Still in the style of goofy vs clever. I'm not a fan of those types of movies. Maybe something with Sandra Bullock? Yes I like those also! Have you seen the dialog commercial with skittles and she kisses him and he becomes infected with skittles also. I that one was really clever. Yes, I do think I remember that commercial. Yeah, I never had any desire to watch part 2. I like Jeff Daniels a lot, but that's just not my type of comedy. I like comedies also. Who is your favorite comedian? I you have not seen Coming to America with Eddie Murphy I would like to suggest that movie for you to watch! It has a nice comedy content. Hi I am here to help you look for a movie trailer! what type of trailers do you like to watch? Yes I like Sandra Bullock especially the Movie Rush and there is a recent one she just stared in. I like comedies. Something that's well written and clever. Miss Congenialtiy sounds good. It's definitely one that I'd like to see again. It's a little bit slap-stick, but also clever dialog. I would accept that recommendation. Thank you!"

Who else is in it? Let's see... I can think of three movies that might fit. There is Frozen 2, Playing with Fire and Maleficanent: Mistress of Evil. Would any of those work?

So tell me have you watched A movie called, Jojo Rabbit. haha like the new ghostbusters. i think people are tired of the phony changes that they are making to all these original stories. i have seen the trailer it did look very onteresting I was first confused when they switched the x men to the 70's loved that movie too. i went three times to see it when it first came out One they favour the most is Venom. Well maybe it is but I would at least ask what genre your into that was also a good movie. i am very excited for the next star wars. i think Disney ruined it at first but now i am starting to like them more and more. Star Wars next year is going into an boom with it's 5th sequel. If there is an tie in with the future films it be the next Thor sequel with an female main cast member as thor. loved that movie. i dont remember any other movie in the past with that story I got tired of it, my headphones have to be replaced for my laptop i like sci fi and really am into almost every genre JoJo Rabbit, an awsome film about childhoodlaughter in middle world war 2 have you seen mandalorian? what is the recommendation?

There was also a really great one I watched with my boyfriend a little while ago about life with invisible illness (I struggle with chronic, debilitating pain but at such a young age you get a lot of doubt both from medical professionals and employers as well as family and friends) and it was a really positive story about finding the best in a less than ideal situation and creating change. It was really amazing I liked a documentary about adoption stories, and also the Mr. Rogers PBS documentary Awesome. More of a positive story about the underdog rising above, thriller documentaries, food industry, etc.? Or kind of just across the board? I myself like a lot of different documentaries - I get lost on YouTube a lot watching trailers lol. That sounds so encouraging! What movie do you recommend? What else are you typically into? Do you usually look more toward family based movies so you can all watch together? Ah - I'm a nanny and the boy i take care of has been telling me all about that lol. Are you into alot of superhero/action based movies or are you a little more across the board? OH MY GOD I LOVED that!!!! Mr. Rogers was such an influential person to me back in my younger years (I say being 27 currently) and that documentary made me cry so hard! He was such an amazing man with such great core values. I saw Spiderman Far From Home. It was cool! Yes, a little snowy out but otherwise good! my spouse and kids like action, so I go along for the ride :) but they are okay Hi!

Is that an anima? Because if it is, I believe I have already seen that one too. I haven't seen that one. wow am impressed, i like it a lot, the realationships are what draws me to it.

The Mandilorian is amazing. Jon favreau did a great job directing it. Oh man, I haven't seen Iron Man in ages. I think that's what we will watch today! Thank you so much for the recommendation!

Great question, I think at this time I'd like just a comedy. How about one with Will Ferrell? He was very popular on SNL. YES! He is one of the best!:) I'd like to recommend Holmes & Watson. It's relatively new, from last year, and features Will Ferrell and also John C. Reilly. I haven't even heard about this movie before. Do you have a brief synopsis? Hello. Okay, what was the last movie you watched? Okay, do you prefer to see a comedic thriller, or just any comedy in general? Not particularly, but I love any actor or actress from Saturday Night Live. Good morning! The last movie I watched was Knives Out, which was a comedic thriller. It was great! Thanks for that. Is there a specific actor/actress you'd like to see? Can I help you find a movie today?"
46,"['Tom Holland', 'Spider-Man', 'Avenger', 'Thor', 'Black Widow']"," Sure thing! What genre of movie do you usually watch? Oh,is Spider-Man Homecoming the newest ones. Looks like there have been multipule Spiderman movies in the past fifteen years. I have thought about seeing that movie. Is it any good? Hello, thanks for helping me. I really enjoyed it! The interesting part to me was seeing how Peter's friends from the first movie play such a large role in helping him as Spiderman, considering that I would usually think of Spiderman as a loner by necessity. It made me think about the character in a different way. I like action and fantasy. I also like good character driven movies. Thanks, you as well! Thats hard to say. The last Avengers movie was really good. Hello, I'm here to help you find a good movie trailer! That is a new take, I think your right seeing him as a loner. I enjoed the Wolverine movies he is certainly a loner. Very character driven I enjoyed watching his emotions as he delt with taking carte of X-23 in the last film. I will give Spiderman Far From home a watch, thank you for the sugestion. You're right, those two characters have a lot of similarities story-wise, even though their personalities are so different. Sure thing! And if you have not seen the first one yet, Spider-Man Homecoming, make sure to give that a watch first! That makes sense, Spiderman has been redone so many times! There is even a new animated movie called Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse that subverts the traditional story by skipping most of it. It would be a fun option to pair with the Tom Holland versions for comparison. ?Ohh, that movie gave me so many different emotions. Thor had me laughing so hard, but I sobbed at the funeral for Black Widow. If you liked that movie, have you thought of watching Spiderman: Far From Home? Yes, Spider-man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home are the newest versions. Tom Holland plays Spiderman in these movies and they are a part of the ongoing Marvel cinematic universe, which is why this Spiderman was in the recent Avengers movie that you mentioned! Me too. Movies where someone grows throughout the story are somehow really rewarding to watch. What would you say is your favorite movie that you've seen in the last year? Ok, I think I have heard of that too. Spider Gwen is in it. I will check that out too! Oh, good. Thank makes sense. I can never keep track with all the reboots and things in movies some time.

Though Marvel movies have been better the last few years than DC I have seen many DC movies but love Marvel! Have you seen Endgame yet? You should definitely check out the first one! Its an amazing story of a man tries to turn his life around because of his little girl. Its a little different than the other marvel movies but so good! Sounds good! I will definitely watch it. I like fantasy action/adventure movies What kind of movies do you like? Lol!! I almost cried during that scene too! Yeah they aren't on there. I guess the problems between Disney and Sony kept them off but I'm not completely sure why. I wish the spiderman movies were on Disney+ Yes. The scene where all the supers came back made me teary, but when they showed spidey, i full on cried lol Hi! I'm looking forward to watching something new. What do you recommend?

It depends on the time. I like horror, thrillers, drama, family movies, some comedy. Not that crazy slap stick stuff, but more sarcastic humor. No I haven't. Who is in it? Yeah, Tom Hanks is great. So, in general, what types of movies to you most like? Sully Great, would you be interested in seeing a trailer No, I remember the trailer that I saw once.

It seems like a very serious movie. Is there like an intro type of horror movie for peeps such as myself? Those are all great movies and seen them all several times. I do like documentary's too! I recently saw one about the foods we eat. I don't remember the name but was very captivating. Do you like documentary's? I understand what you mean. I look at the old James Bond movies and laugh on how fake the fight scense look. Is there a fight scene you like in a particular movie? I don't really watch movies with fight scenes. So you would want to watch IT? Yes, I do! I like documentaries that focus around mysteries. Ever since I was a baby, my mom would always be watching true crime documentaries and shows. That's probably why! Do you like true crime? Hello! I'm here to help you with finding a good movie! What are some of your favorite movies currently? I guess the old 80's IT would be an example of that. It was never intended to be a comedy. But watching it today, you're sure to get a good laugh at Pennywise! That's a good movie! Do you want to watch something similar to that? I don't watch comedies as much as horror movies, but my favorite would probably South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. It's a musical but all the songs are amazing. I remember when I was a kid I watched it with my mom, and we still quote it every day several years later! On top of that, its a great commentary on censorship, commentary that still holds up 20 years later. Would you be interested in that? So you enjoy realistic movies? If you're looking for a crime/drama like The Irishman, I'd recommend Goodfellas, The Godfather, or El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. Or do you mean a non-fiction movie, like a documentary? Totally like them! Its amazing how they find the criminal and how they go about it. I don't like movies which are violent. Not into seeing others in pain nor want to see blood spattered which is why I have not been watching more of the true crime documentary's recently. How about you, do you like horror and gory movies? I would recommend Get Out. Would you be interested in that? Sure, I enjoy movies which tell the story of real life, what do you have in mind? They sound interesting and totally worth the look. What other kinds of movies are you interested in? I'm a 56 yr old man so I can get into some of the older movies. Especially comedies! Have any favorites? How about Split? Its about a man with 23 personalities that kidnaps 3 girls. It was my first horror movie. It's more of a thriller and not so much a gore fest. Or, the original 80's IT is pretty good as well. It's quite a long one, but it is a good story. It's also not quite as scary as many of the other horror movies. Would you be interested in either of these? I do. I like the classic horror movies such as Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I like being scared when I watch movies. However, I just don't find them scary.I think stories are the most important part to a movie, however others I talk to seem to disagree.What about you, what do you value the most when it comes to movies? I love south park and another slam dunk! Its fun to watch someones commentaries on current events with a little comedy in its thread. I did like the Mel Brooks movies in the day. I remember my Father and I laughing till it hurt watching those movies. So is there a movie that you like which is a blend between horror and comedy? Hi, i like to see the Irishman I agree with you that the stories are the main ingredient in a movie. What horror movies have good stories. And can we please move this a little faster. Sure I will give it a try. Keeping the remote nearby!"

He's also developed a special familial bond with a woman named Maria and her teenage granddaughter Gabriela. But when a vicious Mexican cartel kidnaps Gabriela, Rambo crosses the border on a bloody and personal quest to rescue her and punish those responsible Which of the movies that you mentioned has the better plot?

It depicts a band of women that scheme and trick Wall Street men out of money! It has a lot of big name stars including J-Lo, Lizzo, Cardi B and Lili Reinhart! That sounds really good! If you like movies about women and crime, you might like Widows! It's set in contemporary Chicago.

How is Tom Cruise's acting in that movie compared to others? I see, sounds interesting, but for me i enjoy movies more centered around action, do you have any reccomendations There's Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and instead of Matt Damon the fourth movie in the series The Bourne Legacy stars Jeremy Renner. La La Land is about Ryan Gosling playing a struggling jazz musician who falls in love with Emma Stone who's a barista aspiring to become an actress. It's a musical as well, so there's a lot of singing. That sound's like a fantastic movie, i will definitely will check it out sometime! Thank you very much for that recommendation! Yes, what was the last movie that you saw? My personal favorite is La La Land, because it is both a drama and comedy. Yes, Mission Impossible: Fallout is the best action movie I've seen thus far. You cannot go wrong with Tom Cruise jumping out of an airplane and chasing after bad guys. I will, by chance do you know of any other movies that involve drama? No problem. Hope you enjoy it! Tom Cruise does some of his best stuff in Mission Impossible: Fallout, but the best of the Mission:Impossible series is Ghost Protocol. Fallout is interesting because it shows Tom Cruise as an older man who is still trying to keep up with the action of chasing bad guys. What other notable actor's and actress's are on the Jason Bourne Series? Hi, how can I help you? Yes, there's quite a few. If you want drama and action, I would recommend the Jason Bourne series.

I like dramas like gangster and war movies. I also like comedies but humor is so subjective. I saw a fantastic movie this weekend with my granddaughter. It was Frozen 2. Have you seen a movie recently? I have but only the original Japanese one and the American remake. None of the sequels. I like Sam Elliott in The Big Lebowski a lot. I did. I do like ghost movies. The Shining is fantastic. Do you have any recommendations in that sub-genre? I am very well. Actually I'm bored and looking for a movie to watch. I also watched Road House this past week.

I saw the trailer on Youtube. It looked really good! Uncut Gems stars Adam Sandler. It's about the stock market and the journey of a wall street start up beginner, who tries to make a name of himself. It's crime and suspense with wide notes of comical energy.

Well you might like to check into Charlies Angels, it looks fun and its a comedy and light-hearted enough for the holidays. Hope you enjoy it! Hmmm I haven't heard of that.

122,"['Star Wars', 'Ad Astra', 'sci fi']"," Yea the film has big stars in it. Basically the film is a mix of murder mystery, crime, thriller, with heavy aspects of comedy. Overall the comedy offsets the cime aspect of the film making it a fun watch. Overall the film is about a family where a murder takes place and the cast tries to solve who was murdered. Without spoilers thats how much I can really go into. I saw a trailer for it, i think. What's it about? It has some big stars, doesn't it? HI Yeah--I remember now--it has Captain AMerica in it. I like this recommendation. Thanks! Would you be interested in seeing any new sci fi movies as well? What movie genres are you currently interested in?

Yes, I always look for new movies to watch I'm glad you enjoyed it. Sure, Ill check it out. I usually just search the internet for whats new. They add new movies on the first of the month I think Nice. I always forget to check when new movies are added to Netflix. I think next year will be exciting for new movies. I heard Avatar 2 is coming next year Got it. If you saw it as a kid, like I did, the new one is a great mix of the action from that one with a little more adult humor. They aged the series really well. No. Have you? Yes. I've seen the first one and am definitely checking out the sequel when it comes out. Yes, I love it. Its really action packed. You know, I didn't actually see the first one. I think I prefer reading sci-fi to watching it. Except for Star Trek. Speaking of sci-fi, did you happen to see Zathura? It was written by the same author as Jumanji and is technically in the same cinematic universe. I think they could add much more.. sometimes theres only few new movies available. I would like to see much more for sure. I think they could also add more documentaries about science and travel Hi there. I hear you're looking for a movie trailer. Yes, I watched Zathura. It was a great movie Ok, thanks. Ill check it out Have you seen the original film with Robin Williams? Sometimes old adventure movies are more fun to watch. Netflix just added The Time Machine, Im definitely gonna watch it again. If you're familiar with Reddit, there's a page on there just about new documentaries and they'll mention where the movies can be streamed."

Your taste is somewhat similar like me. However Action & Thriller movies are my favorite. The animation is really awesome. I enjoyed very much. What type of movies do you like? I like all movies! My taste ranges from indie drama films all the way to movies appropriate for children such as yours. I haven't watched both of them. I have heard about Nightcrawler. I will try to watch. Have you ever seen any of the John Wick movies? I will watch the 3 for sure. I like the movies with nice screenplay. I don't like the movies with the expected ending or boring screenplay. I was in Destin last weekend. It was nice. I have heard about the Elf movie, however I didn't get a chance to watch so far. Tom Hardy, Ryan Gosling, and Jake Gyllenhall in more independent films,actually. He has some films not many people are familiar with. Have you heard of the movie Drive or Nightcrawler? I watched Lion King today. I watched earlier. Again I watched with my 4 year old daughter today. Is it the newest release? or the animated version from 1994? It's been great. I live in Florida so the weather has been wonderful. I did stay in though last night and rewatched Elf, though. It's a classic! I am doing pretty good. Hows your weekend? He is great. His voice is more unique. What did you like about the movies, or anything you didn't like? Sometimes action movies get monotonous with the plot. Are you wanting to watch the 3rd or do you feel more apathetic about it? Tom Hardy is great and has some amazing action/thriller films he is in as well. Are you a Tom Hardy fan? Oh, what did you think of it overall? I saw it in theaters this summer. He starred in Locke, and the film is just him in a car the entire time; it's actually brilliant. I watched the 1 & 2. I have to watch the 3rd. Its the latest release. Hi, how are you doing today? I am a big fan. Who is your favorite?"

And do you normally watch movies online with something like Netflix/Hulu or do you prefer to watch in the movie theater? Have you seen any of the Austin Powers movies? I've never heard of it, but it sounds intriguing. Tell me more :) I like watching both in theater and at home, but Netflix is usually where I watch movies. I recently had my friends watch This Is The End, since they hadn't seen it. I love that movie. Do you want to watch something similar to that or something new? I love Rowan Atkinson! I love Mr. Bean! I am definitely interested in this now. I love his chaotic but innocent energy. Great! I'm excited to hear what you may have picked out! What kind of movies do you normally like to watch? Something similar, at least in the vein of being funny, but also ridiculous. I'm a fan of dumb comedies, to be honest. The dumber the better. What about Johnny English? Its been a couple of years since I've watched it but I remember it being similar to Austin Powers in the line of dumb spy comedy. I've seen the first two, and part of the third, which I thought sucked, sadly. The first one is a classic. It's got the guy from Mr. Bean in it. Basically he's a mess of an agent because the directors of the agency never really intended for him to become an agent. I love comedies and documentaries, personally. Comedies especially."
143,"['Bad Santa', 'newer']"," Hm, there's a few new ones for this year that look like they might be funny. Netflix movies are perfectly acceptable! There's a new Disney one called Noelle that looks funny! It's about Kris Kringle's Daughter, where she wants to find her role, since her brother is Nick, who takes over for Santa eventually. Or is supposed to, if he was good at it! So I think it will have a lot of silly moments. Oh that definetely seems like something I would enjoy! Thanks for the recommendation - I accept it! Sounds kinda similar to what I watched last night, which was about Santa's daughter and how she wanted to go to college and not take over the family business. Hello! Good morning! That sounds funny too! I hope you enjoy it! Getting into the Christmas spirit! Yes I am! Well, since it is the holiday season I love watching Christmas movies. I know the ones on Netflix are not considered good movies but they are fun and I enjoy laughing at and with them. So what sort of movies are you into? What sort of trailers do you like?

It's not absolutely necessary, but I think you will enjoy the third movie more if you have as much background information as possible, so I would recommend watching them in order. Plus the second is a great movie too! Avengers: End Game was a great movie, definitely one of my favorites from the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Let me see if I can find something similar that you will enjoy. Do you have to see the second one to understand the third? Yes! I'd like to see it. I really like action movies and movies with great acting. Hi! Yes I am! which movie? Are you a fan of the John Wick movies?

I watched Us recently and I liked that a lot There's a documentary called Behind the Curve which is about conspiracy theorists and is pretty fun and surprising. There's also a lot of climate change documentaries, although they can be pretty depressing. I usually like things that are more political or about something surprising - I recently watched Tell Me Who I Am and Fahrenheit 11/9 and I liked both of those, though I thought 11/9 was pretty biased It's weird but visually really beautiful and worth watching. Have you seen any Ari Aster movies? They're pretty scary and suspenseful. Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a really cute and fun documentary about a man who has a famous sushi restaurant. What kind of subjects do you like for documentaries? I've never heard of them - what are some of their movies? Oh okay! I've seen Hereditary and I've heard about Midsommer but I wasn't sure if I would like it - it seemed to get mixed reviews okay cool I'll maybe check it out! Do you have any other recommendations? I also like documentaries It depends - I don't like horror movies that are just gore or things jumping out, but I like movies that are suspenseful and keep you guessing Midsommer and Hereditary, one is about a couple going to Sweden and finding a cult, and one is about a family haunted by demons. Us is a great movie! Do you like horror movies in general? What was the latest movie that you saw and liked? Hi there, I hear you're looking for a movie? It talks about people who think the earth is flat, and how that effects them and their lives as people push them away for seeming crazy. Oh wow. It's wild how flat earthers are such a big movement! Hi, you heard right!"

Something within the last 2-3 years. I am interested in a horror film that is in an ordinary place. Somewhere that typically doesn't have scary experiences.

Very funny and plenty of action! Wow I didn't know that. The first one is a classic. Because of it, Netflix is finally making a 4th Beverly Hills Cop movie. One of my top favorite action comedy movies is the first one. I don't think I've seen either of those although I feel like I should have. I know Lock Stock is referenced in some of the shows i have watched. Awesome! What was the last action or comedy movie you watched? The second one is awesome as well.

When you say history movies, do you mind if they are war movies? Yeah I have seen That one. Awesome! Historical films are a little bit tougher, since most of the recent historical films seem to all revolve around major wartime events, for example, the movie 1917 that is going to be releasing soon. However, I have a film you may be interested that isn't quite war based! There is a movie named The King that is available on Netflix! It has received some great reviews, especially for it's cinematography and beautiful camera shots. It has an impressive cast. How Many series are there?? And yes I can check the trailer. Yes i have heard of it. And yeah go ahead Awesome! I am Number Four is an exciting and gripping movie about these persons that have powers called legacies. It is based off of a book series.

The trailer is here, if you want to check it out and let me know what you think! Hi! How are you! I'm here to help you find a cool movie trailer to watch! What kind of movies do you enjoy watching? Hello! I like Comedy, Heroes and History Movies This movie is based off of the first novel in a seven novel series! I really hope they make movies out of the sequels. This, in my opinion, was an underrated film. It isn't as crazy intricate as Marvel/DC movies are, but it definitely does have very exciting sequences and puts a nice little smile on your face at the end. The trailer can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_U6ctjOaic Awesome! That was a fun movie. Speaking of fun, have you heard about the new Eddie Murphy comedy coming out? It is called Dolemite Is My Name. I am putting it up in a recommendation if you would like to check it out! I used to like war movies but now I like them about 20% OH wow the movie look very interesting, I wanna see it. Do you have any other recommendation? Yes I like the Marvel heroes. Never heard of I am Number Four Yes! Have you ever seen the movie Hancock with Will Smith? It is an awesome movie about a homeless superhero who doesn't know how to use his powers responsibly, and his growth as he becomes a better superhero. Okay! What kind of heroes do you like? Do you like the Marvel/DC Universe type heroes? Or are you open to other kinds? For example, have you heard of I Am Number Four? What is the movie (The King) about??"

I like watching someone do something on screen that I can't. Hello! What is the last movie that you saw? Zombieland 2 is a sequel to Zombieland, where strangers are brought together as a survival team in the zombie apocalypse. The second movie shows them years later as they have grown into more of a family unit, and some drama threatens their relationship. Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin. Wow, I really like Woody Harrelson's acting. That sounds like a good movie. Who was the director? Hm, sounds very interesting. I do like comic book movies as well. What is the plot of Zombieland 2? The last movie I saw was Avengers: End Game. Same here! Joker is a really great origin story, but if you like an action-packed comedy, I'd really recommend Zombieland 2. I've heard really good things about Joker. It may be a bit too dark for me. What is the plot about? Do you normally prefer movies based on comics? It pretty much shows how the Joker fit into society when he was trying to function as a normal human being, and it gives insight on his mental illness and background as a clown-like character. It is kind of dark, which definitely makes sense to his character. Yes, I do. I really enjoy actions movies, in general. The plot sounds pretty scary and funny. Who stars in Zombieland 2? What do you like about them?"

I hope you enjoy it. Thanks, I think it will be a great movie night. I do, but I was thinking something more spy thiller I am looking for an action type movie I like Bond, maybe one of the older one's. What is your favorite one?

What was the last one you watched? Hands down would be Deadpool and Deadpool 2 especially if you love the X-Men! That was a good movie! You must like the edge of your-seat-kind of suspense. I'd totally recommend the movie Split! I saw the first one, is Deadpool 2 about a similar plot? Sounds great, what do you recommend? He's James McAvoy, he's also the younger Professor X from the X-Men movies. He dd an amazing job jumping between characters. He's the only actor ever to play so many in one film. I just watched Shutter Island, big fan Hmm depends. What kinda genre are you looking for? What do you think about the new Joker? I prefer a suspense movie Only a little. It pushes more as a continuation from the first one. Deadpool actually gets a team together and learns the meaning of family. Wow, that sounds interesting. Who's the main actor? Must have been hard to play 25 different people What is that about? Hi! I'm here to help you find a trailer!"

Yeah, I feel like Spies in Disguise is more of a kids' movie. Not that that's a bad thing, just not quite my thing. Lol, I hadn't thought of it that way. Now I won't be able to unthink it. Argh. For me it was mostly that the whole central conflict of the movie chase could have been avoided if Admiral Holdo wasn't a terrible commander. Are you more into serious action or comedic action? Let's see what happens in this next one. Are you a Browncoat, by chance? Excellent choice of name! I'll take it you've already got Rise of Skywalker on your calendar There's a new Bad Boys coming out in January. The first two were very much in the Lethal Weapon/Rush Hour school of action. I'm a big fan of science fiction and action movies. What's good right now? How do you feel about Star Wars? Oh yeah! I remember seeing a couple of trailers for that. That's perfect. I accept this recommendation. Definitely. The Last Jedi was pretty awful, but I'm hoping with JJ Abrams back at the helm, this one will be better. Is there any other good color? Well, I have a son that we named Luke. Does that give you an idea?:) Science fiction! Serenity, Star Trek, that sort of thing. Excellent! I hope you enjoy the film. Probably more action comedy. Movies like Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour where there's a lot of action, but also some great laugh lines. Yes. I enjoyed them both. I think Bad Boys is a good recommendation. Me too. Will Smith's been in a bunch of good movies lately, so hopefully this one's good too. I'm looking forward to Spies in Disguise, his new animated movie. That could also be an action comedy, though I get more comedy than action. The part that got me in that one was the Leia/Mary Poppins bit. What other types of movies do you enjoy? Hi there!

First off, what is your favorite kind of movie to watch - drama, action, comedy, etc? You should watch the trailer - I think it came out in 2016. If you like the trailer, I highly recommend the movie. And if you like the movie, I very highly recommend the book series by Lee Child! The plot is - Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name while on the run as a fugitive from the law. Besides Tom Cruise, the movie stars Cobie Smulders and Aldis Hodge. I am not sure of the star rating, but I liked it! Have you seen any of the Jack Reacher movies with Tom Cruise? While I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I am a big fan of the Lee Child's book character Jack Reacher. And the latest Jack Reacher movie - Never Go Back has a great plot. Those are my favorites too! Have you seen the latest Mission Impossible with Tom Cruise? Thanks again. Do you happen to know how many movies are out about this character? Hello! I am well, thanks! I am ready!

It is one of the best Disney movies. Okay then. I will watch it next time I get the chance over the next few days. I've seen that already. I would actually wanted to watch something lighter after seeing Us. Maybe a newer Disney film from the past few years since you mentioned that earlier. The last movie I watched was actually Us, the Jordan Peele directed film earlier this year. Hi! Did you enjoy a nice Thanksgiving? How is Frozen as a movie? All I know about it is the Let it Go and Build a Snowman songs? It would be nice to enjoy the quiet and watch a good historical movie. What was the last movie you watched? Sounds interesting. Would you recommend I see over the other Disney animated films from the last few years? It is the best one? I live by myself, so I usually watch movies alone barring the rare time I have a friend or family member over or I'm at their place and we watch something. Yeah, I enjoyed Disney movies a lot growing up but haven't seen any of the newer ones recently. I was maybe thinking of watching some of them though. It is a little different in that it isn't the traditional saved by the prince. It is about the strength in family/sibling love. But, there are some great comedic moments as well. And, the music is really good. Yes, yes. It's one of the times my family actually sits and watches a movie. We love Disney movies. Do you? What type movies to you typically enjoy? Same here.

Can you recommend any movies? I would also recommend assassin's creed. I think this may be right down your alley I re-watched Avengers Endgame last week. I can't get enough. I have. It was technically a comic book movie, but the whole untrustworthy narrator plot took away some of it. I had no idea at the end if it was real or not. Plus, I doubt it will tie into any other movies. Comic book moves are my favorite now, but I also like comedies and action movies. I saw the original but have not seen the remake yet. I would love to watch it however as I hear it is quite good. Thank you for the recommendation. reviews were mixed but it did win a few awards. How about the x-men: apocalypse movie? great! what kind of movies do you like? I would recommend aquaman if you haven't already seen it. Jason Momoa is a great actor Good, how are you? okay! perfect. have you watched any good movies recently? Have you seen the most recent Joker movie? I think this would be a great movie for you to check out. I have seen this. It might be my favorite DC based movie. It was bright when it needed to be and had some character development. hi, how are you doing today? I like comedies and drama as well as animated movies. I would definitely recommend the Lion King that was released this year. The soundtrack was wonderful and i loved the graphics That I did see. Again, Michael fassbender. I am a comic fan first, so it was a bit odd, but a movie I enjoyed. I've heard great things about that series. I have not seen too many action movies recently"
179,"['Us', 'Darren Aronofsky', 'Black Swan', 'Pi']"," Got it. Nice! The next suggestion isn't quite coming-of-age, but definitely small-budget and terrifying in a psychological thriller kind of way... Ever seen Pi by Darren Aronofsky? Doing well. I hear you are interested in movies? Very good! How about yourself? Seen ANY Aronofsky films? They all have some thematic similarities. Pi is about a guy's obsession with number theory, to summarize it VERY briefly. No I haven't! But I love psychological thrillers, what's that one about? I like indie and coming of age stories. I'm also always down for a good horror film. yes! I've seen Black Swan and Mother! Both were absolutely excellent and so unsettling Same! It's what my degree is in, actually. Do you have a favorite genre? Have you seen the film Us? Got some interesting family dynamics, which is also important in all of the good coming of age films, etc. Definitely far from a conventional horror narrative and it is willing to push boundaries, so that gives off the indie vibe, etc. Think you might like it! I love movies! Definitely one of my passions Hey! How's it going? Yes I did see it! I thought Lupita Nyongo's performance was amazing. And definitely agree about the family dynamics part."

Hi Love Will Smith! I will have to look for that trailer. Do you know when it was released? Recently? Is that the movie with Denzel Washington? I think I saw that one. Oh, is that the one where the used CGI to create a younger Will Smith? Yes! did you liked it It was relaesed recently I did! He is a great actor. Do you know of any other movies he has done? Hey! How are you? I'm looking for a movie recommendation. It's Monday, and I am bored. Have you seen any movies lately? What could you recommend? No!! What do you know about it? Sounds interesting. I love sci-fi, fantasy, action/adventure..is there a trailer for that movie?"
181,['A Quiet Place']," I love indie, comedy, coming of age and thrillers. I also love horror! I am not a fan of action films or romance much. oh my gosh YES! I am such a fan of Bill Hader too, I thought that was perfect. Did you see Get Out or Us? What did you think? I thought get out was phenomenal and Us was really scary but had lots of plot holes. I think he could've built the world a little better but I thought Lupita's performance was absolutely terrifying, she really made the movie for me. and her voice?! Holy crap. That and her physical movements. I thought that was such a standout performance. Apparently she didn't tell anyone she was doing the voice like that until they started rolling and the other actors were absolutely terrified. Us was probably one of the most terrifying films I've seen in a long time, not because of the film itself, but because of the theory of a secret world. Hello! Do you know what kind of movies do you like? What was the last horror movie you watched? I saw It 2 myself and it was fantastic! I think the casting was perfect Hi there! I saw Midsommar in theaters. I didn't think it was scary, more just upsetting, I really liked Hereditary which is from the same director. I've also been wanting to see It 2, I loved the original and the remake!"

Yes it is very intense I often opt for movies that are realistic and grounded in their premises, and feature characters that don't cleanly fit into any stereotype Does The Joker have a good deal of action in it? You mentioned suspense, does it deliver the suspense well? I do enjoy a good drama, actually. Then I do think you would enjoy Joker"

The story was just okay though, have you seen any movies recently? I have not see it yet, but I have heard some things about it. Did you like it? Hi I am wondering if you have seen any good movies lately? Oh no! That is what I was afraid of! I have not gotten a chance to look at the Frozen 2 toys yet. Definitely not, plenty of kids in the theater for Frozen 2. Just hope they're well-behaved! The kids in my theater were very quiet, aside from laughing at Olaf. The songs weren't bad at all, I just don't think they can top Let it Go. Y'know? I think your kids are just the right age for Frozen 2 to come out though. I was wondering if the songs were good in Frozen? The last movie I saw was the Addams Family I do go to a lot of animated movies, mostly because that is what my kids pick, but I do like them. Quite a few actually! Though the bad news is your kids might ask for toys of some of them, there was this really cool water horse I remember. It was beautiful. They were good, none of them were bad but I don't think any of them were that amazing. Oh, so you like animated movies? Well, Frozen 2 is definitely entertaining for the whole family, I think! How old are your kids? Yes, Olaf is a favorite character of mine and the kids. I was hoping he would be in Frozen 2! Well that is something to look forward to. I will probably take them on Monday since they have off school. I am sure I won't be the only one with that idea! Well theres probably quite a few, they add a lot of cute new little characters. There was also a salamander that's pretty cute, I did like the new characters in the movie."

I do, I am into comedy and action the most. What about you? i really liked both Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody, but i also love comedies. which ones have you seen recently and can recommend? Definitely Rodger Moore. Sure thing. I think you will enjoy it. You also said you like action movies. Does this mean you like James Bond? I recommend Long Shot with Seth Rogen. His role is different that his other movies so it was interesting watching him. It was a good movie that I would recommend. Good Boys is another good comedy. Same producers as Super bad. hi, do you like movies? That sounds like a great idea. I love Tim Allen and Tom Hanks. I will go see Toy Story 4 this weekend. Thank you for this recommendation.

Although that is my stance, it may soon change after watching the 4th one. In my best Woody voice: Thanks partner Nice! Good to hear that you liked it! Cheeky Comedy movies tend to be my favorite right now. Family movies such as Disney are always lovable. Funny you ask, I am actually looking for a recommendation. Glad to hear! You should check out Shazam! It's very funny and fun and if you're a Disney fan definitely watch Toy Story 4. Bill Murray is a very famous actor and has been in quite a few movies now. He is easily one of the greatest to do it. I have heard of Groundhog Day and maybe seen it before but wouldn't hurt to check it out.

Great movie, Matthew McConaughey is a good actor. So was Anne Hathaway. I watched the ones with Toby McGuire when I was younger, and those are amazing too. But I actually really love what they have done with the new version of Spiderman. In Spiderman Homecoming, Peter Parker is kind of like a geeky, weak high-school student who doesn't have a lot going for him until he becomes Spiderman! It's a refreshing twist on Spiderman in my opinion; it's a retelling, not a replacement for Toby McGuire's famous Spiderman! Yeah, I'll take you up on the recommendation to watch Age of Ultron. Did you notice they are also making a movie about Black Widow? I enjoyed that character from The Avengers I haven't heard of Jojo Rabbit, is a drama? War movie? Then I think my final recomendation will actually be Avengers: Age of Ultron. I know you like science fiction and the Avengers, so I feel like this is logically the next best movie for you to watch! Spiderman isn't in this movie, but he appears in the next one; however, you have to watch the Avengers movies in order to understand what's going on in them. So what do you think? Great, I love movies. Anything you can recommend? I've been watching a lot of science fiction movies recently. I recently watched the 1st avengers movie, I especially liked the Incredible Hulk. Reminds me of my childhood. I did! Doesn't Scarlette Johanson star as Black Widow? I don't know a lot about her storyline, but she is definitely amazing in her role as Black Widow! She appears in the subsequent Avenger's movies as well, so you should enjoy her in those. I just saw Jojo Rabbit in theaters and she stars as the mother of Jojo. The story takes place in Nazi Germany during World War II and she is great in her role as the mother of the boy. If you ever have time, Jojo Rabbit is still in theaters and it's a must see! I actually just No I haven't, the last Spiderman I watched were the ones with Toby McGuire. Ah, the Avengers movies are so good! I personally adore the Avengers Universe and I think my favorite movie so far has been Spiderman Homecoming with Tom Holland as Spiderman. Have you seen that movie? Hello! I am here to help you find a movie to watch! He was-- Spiderman actually shows up in the third Avenger Movie, Avengers: Infinity War. I think he was an addition that they hadn't thought of before, so they introduced him first in Captain America: Civil War before he was actually in Spiderman: Homecoming. But yes, he is introduced in the third Avengers movie and then he is in all of the subsequent Avenger's movies! I plan to watch the rest of the avengers movies, it'll be interesting to see how Spiderman affects the movie. I also watched Captain Marvel the other day, I enjoyed the performance by Brie Larson, and Samuel Jackson is always good. Well, my absolute favorite movie of all time is Interstellar, and it's pretty science fiction(y)-- have you ever seen it? I completely agree-- the entire movie just blew my mind because it's science fiction but it's honestly something that actually could happen one day. But if you've already seen that, then let's focus on finding you something new! What's the last movie you watched and what did you like or not like about it? Yes, Scarlett Johansson. I remember seeing her in a movie called The Horse Whisperer, it was a sad movie. But Scarlett Johansson gave a nice performance. It may have been one of her 1st movies. I'm trying to think of what else she has appeared in, all I can think of is The Island Perhaps I should watch the newer ones. Right now I'm wondering why Spiderman wasn't included in the avengers, wasn't he also a Stan Lee creation?"

So you've seen the trailer? Would you watch it again? It was great. Kind of reminded me of The Ring. Did you see that one?

Did you see The Nun? yeah, its like they don't really know what they're doing yet but it's classed as horror so I guess both maybe? I do. I like comedies and action. What do you like? That one does sound like its going to be maybe the first decent x-men movie in a while lol I love watching all kinds of movies, how about you? I haven't seen those yet, but I'm pretty excited to see The New Mutants"
204,"['Terminator: Dark Fate', 'Play', 'Prime', 'Amazon']"," Wow, that's impressive. I hope they continue the Terminator franchise for a few more movies. Ok, I can help you with that. What's the last action movie you watched? Yes, I agree. Do you subscribe to Amazon Prime Video or YouTube TV? And how much did you like it? Great, thanks! I will accept your recommendation. I was a big fan of T2: Judgement Day so I'm happy to see them both back in this one. Glad to have your help too! Hello, I'm looking for an action movie trailer! I've seen all the Marvel Movies, so I liked it a lot. One of my favorites. It is a good one. Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger do a great job in it. Avengers: End Game No, but I've heard some good things about it. Just so you know, that movie made 261 million at the box office!! Awesome, so glad I could help you! Ok, so would you prefer something not Marvel related? No, Marvel is related is fine. But I'm open to anything as long as it's got an interesting story. I'm not a fan of Michael Bay action movies. Neither, I'm a Netflix user. It's the best! Hmm, ok. Have you seen Terminator:Dark Fate? Hello. I'd like to help you find a movie trailer."

209,"['mystery', 'dark comedy', 'Uncut Gems', 'Taxi', 'Adam Sandler', 'Oscar', 'Knives Out']"," I love movies and would love to hear your recommendations. Glad you enjoyed it too. Wow, so you appreciate many genres! Another movie I loved was Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler. it is quite a departure from what you are used to seeing from Sandler. I also didn't see the ending coming from a mile away which I really appreciate. I would tell you to give it a shot. Sandler is really good in it and I think he got robbed by not getting nominated for an Oscar. The supporting characters are great as well, and Kevin Durant's role is not just a cameo, he is integral part of the story. Definitely recommend it. Ha ha. I'm somewhere in between. I saw it when I was very, very young. Yes. Indina Manzel (sp?) is his wife and Judd Hirsh is his father-in-law. The other actors are people who I have seen in other things, but don't know them by name but you will recognize them. Hi! I have seen several movies lately that I would recommend. Good to know. That makes me more interested. Did you know who any of the other actors were because he is the only one I have heard anything about? If you like mystery/whodunit movies, I would recommend Knives Out. It has a great cast, twist and turns, and a bit of dark comedy. I did see Knives Out and I definitely enjoyed it. I do enjoy a mystery. I also enjoy horror, drama, and comedy. I watcha lot of movies but some have certainly fallen through the cracks for me. I am familiar with them. Judd Hirsh is a very good actor. I am curious. Good Time was suspenseful but I found myself very bored. Did you feel that way at all about Uncut Gems? What kind of tone did you get from it? Not at all. It is dark for sure. It moves pretty fast, and Sandler is constantly going. It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative. I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it. Absolutely....all the way back to his Taxi days! Yes, I am that old! I am aware of that one but have not seen it. I have been meaning to but the director's last movie Good Time was also well received and I hated it so I have been unsure."
210,"['It', 'dramatic', 'drama', 'movie', 'The Lighthouse', 'Marriage Story', 'Scarlett Johansson', 'Adam Driver', 'Jessica']"," Yes How are you doing today? What was the last drama movie that you watched? Oh I really liked Robert Pattinson in that movie! It was a very different role for him. I liked the suspense It was Lighthouse I most certainly do!

212,"['Amazon', 'Netflix', 'series', 'doctor', 'The Hangover', 'The Hangover Part III']"," Isn't there a guy that used to be a doctor in the movie? Definitely! What's the plot of that one about? Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis. I think Galifianakis is the funniest. I pretty much only like comedies, but I can't wait to watch the Hangover series now! I see. Have you heard of or seen the Hangover series? It's pretty cool! Oops. I think we should discuss more movies. I am trying to show you the trailer. Would you be interested in Hangover III?

He is in Hangover III too Oh cool! Who are the main actors? Nice talking to you too :) The first Hangover film is the funniest. A group of guys throw a bachelor party at Vegas, forget everything and the groom ends up missing. What do you think? What's it about?"
213,"['movie', 'Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again', 'Mia', 'The River Wild']"," Yes, I loved that, and I'd love to see it again. Thanks! Have you seen her in the movie Mamma Mia? She does such a great job in that movie! Hi. I'm looking for a current movie that's character-driven, not having a gimmicky plot. Hello! Meryl Streep, but I don't know if she has a current film. Do you have a favorite actor or actress in mind?"
214,"['The Stranger', 'Will Ferrell', 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', 'Black and White', 'program', 'Fiction']"," One that keeps popping into mind is Central Intelligence! The Rock and Kevin Hart are my favorite! Most type of movies. Well not war movies or sports as much! A good comedy or love story sign me up! Hey there. What kind of moives do you like? Ok, so super goofy comedy. Do you like Ok, Stranger than Fiction stars Will Ferrell. Short plot peek: An I.R.S. auditor suddenly finds himself the subject of narration only he can hear: narration that begins to affect his entire life, from his work, to his love-interest, to his death. Exactly! I do like SNL most of the time. I think it has gotten a bit boring. I enjoyed it more in my high school and college days. Do you like comedy or do you like the war movies haha? Stranger than Fiction, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or Pleasentville.They are good and mind bending, which I love. Oh mind bending is great. I have seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I actually have that movie pop into my head occasionally. I definitely am going to put that on my to watch again list. I have not seen the other two... Interesting. Tell me about the other one! Well if I laugh a lot it is a winner. I do not like immature humor though. What about you? What do you like in movies? Oh nice. So, what is your favorite comedy or love story? Sounds good to me! I like most movies. If you like romantic comedies, I would like to throw out some of my favorites and see if you have seen them yet or not. Sorry, I totally pressed the wrong button there. I was going to ask if you like SNL character type comedies.I do like movies. I see what you are saying. Not Bevis and Butthead. lol"
215,"['Prime', 'new-age', 'After Earth', 'Earth', 'Sharktopus', 'End Game', 'sci fi']"," Sounds rather gruesome with that combination of name! Not my type. Do you have any more information on After Earth, actors in it for instance. It has Will Smith, Jaden Smith and Zoe Kravitz! Hey there! How are you? hi I am fine and you? Oh, I see! Yes, and another is Sharktopus, which is a grueling sci-fi film. yes I do. Star Trek, adventure movies and comedies especially. no last movie I saw was and an adventure one about cars. Isn't there a new one about space? Of course. I would also recommend Avengers: Endgame. This one came out last year and has been highly acclaimed by the public as a great action and sci-fi film. Has one been nominated for best picture? hmmm, They sound like good actors! Is this a post Apocalyptic type movie? I have forgotten the plot. I think the new one as I have already seen Avengers: Endgame. Thank you anyway. today it is more sci-fi on my mind. There are a few new ones about space. I am about to find some good movies in this genre for you that have been nominated. Sci-Fi is great! And have you seen nay of those genre movies in the theaters lately? Yes and it sounds interesting. I think you have found a movie I can get into with interest. Thank you. I'm well! I came to talk to you about your favorite movies. Do you have any? And so would you say your favorite genre is more action or sci-fi? Yes, After Earth has been highly acclaimed. It is a space and sci fi movie you would love. Have you heard of it?"
216,['The Equalizer'], I usually prefer action movies I would probably have to say Denzel Washington I've last seen the Irishman and Once upon a time in Hollywood. hello hi there Is there an actor you like best? Are those your favorite type of movies? So what movies have you seen lately?
217,"['Captain Marvel', 'Parker', 'Avenger', 'action movies', 'Dark Phoenix']"," As for Avenger movies, there haven't been any new ones lately, but for marvel movies, I've heard that Captain Marvel, Spiderman Far from Home, and Dark Phoenix were all good good Im looking for a good action any movies see any lately Yes I have heard it's good!

I'm good how are you"
218,"['Emilia Clarke', 'Last Christmas', 'Game of Thrones', 'season']"," I have seen Emma. It is really funny. Have you read the book Emma? It follows the storyline quite closely I do, but I also like movies with relatively unknown actors as well. Thanks you too!! Yes, I do think that would be something I am interested in. Thanks for the recommendation! Hmmm. Okay then. Also do you like films with big stars in them? Tell me about that movie! I really like seasonal romances as well, especially christmas ones. Well there is a twist, but I won't give it away. Anyhow, do you think such a movie would be something you're interested in seeing? Yeah, you gotta have a story to keep you interested. I think Last Christmas has a story that is interesting and fits the season as well. I guess I like both. Some of my favorites are Nights in Rodenthe, The Time Traveler's Wife, Maid of Honor, and Wedding Date Yes, I was thinking of Emma. It was supposed to be based on a good satire. Well, I guess there are a lot of choices. Do you like new and edgy romance or classic romance films? Hi. Nice to be talking to you. Is this the one where the santa is the boss's son? I really loved the storyline Fair enough. Well I'm still trying to get an idea of what your taste in movies is like. What struck you as good or interesting in The Time Traveler's Wife? No problem. Have a good evening. Sorry, I was also wondering if you would consider romantic comedy? Hi there! I am looking for a good romance movie. Do you have any ideas? Yes I would consider romantic comedies. Do you have one in mind? Sure. A young woman (Emilia Clarke from Game of Thrones) is working as an elf at a store and nothing's going right for her. It is terrible to be alone during the season, and then suddenly she meets someone and things turn around for her. What do you think?"

I'm definitely looking for something family friendly for the holidays. It's not your typical comic book movie, the animation is so fascinating it's a must watch for any animation fan. It's hard to explain, the trailer does a better job of explaining it than I ever could. Would you like to watch it? Yes the Spanish version is actually way better, the music is twice as good! Have you seen Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse? It's a little different from the Disney stuff but the animation is absolutely stunning, it won best Animated Feature last year. If you liked Fantastic Mr.Fox you would probably like Isle of Dogs it definitely has a unique feel which isn't for everyone. Have you seen The Nightmare Before Christmas? That's a classic one and just about the right time of year for it. I will at the end but apparently we need to chat a bit more first, haha. Do you like stop motion animation at all? I love that movie! It relates alot to my heritage so that's why I went to go see it. I should watch again in spanish. Yes! Do you have a link? The animation was beautiful and it was nice to see the characters from my childhood again. I thought it was funnier and more interesting than the first one! Have you seen Coco? It has beautiful animation and pretty good music too. Hi there, can I help you find a movie trailer? I seen some amazing stop animation on youtube! What was it you liked about Frozen 2? No, I haven't. What's it about? Awesome, do you watch a lot of Disney animated films? Nice, have you watched any of the Wes Anderson stop motion animated movies, Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) or Isle of Dogs (2018)? I really enjoyed frozen 2 and as wondering if we may speak about or it or can you recommend me a film similar to it? Fantastic Mr.Fox is an old one, I watched it a while back. I haven't heard of Isle of Dogs though. Whenever I have time! I recently watched the live action Lion King and Inside Out a while back."

Have you seen or heard of Step Brothers? What type of movies are you into? Hello, how are you doing? I usually lean towards comedies and dramas. I don't like science fiction or action. I can do a thriller if it's intelligent. I am doing moderately well. How about yourself? Yes, I have seen that one. It is quite funny. I just saw Frozen 2 on Tuesday, but that was more for my daughters. I want to find something now for myself to watch? Any recommendations?"

Lol yes it did, what about Good Boys It's Adventure Comedy came out earlier this year, the trailer is on youtube I haven't seen that or heard about it. What is it about? oooo ok I'll check it out thanks! No not yet, I would love to though. I'll check it out. I have seen it, it was pretty funny. That came out awhile ago. I'm into horror movies but I like comedy as well."
222,"['21 Bridges', 'Star Wars', 'theater', 'officer']"," Hmm, I've never heard of it. What's the gist? I'm assuming about police shooting people? I tend to get annoyed if movies try to push too hard on a political agenda. I'm open to other ideas. I tend to like action movies and I can't stand horror flicks. Too scary. I like it when movies have a lot of character development. Oh wow, yeah, that sounds like my type of movie. I will definitely go see it considering that plot and that actor. Thanks for your recommendation! I'll go see that movie over the holiday. The last movie I watched was Captain Marvel and I really liked it. You're welcome! Oh, wow. I never really would have thought it would have been the opposite. Interesting. Is it a true story or just fiction? Are you wanting a holiday themed movie or are you open to other ideas as well? I don't like horror either! Way too scary. What was the last movie that you watched? Yes! Great movie. Let me see what I can find that I think you will like. It's fiction. And I had the plot a little bit backwards. 2 fugitives are on the run. 7 officers are killed. Chadwick Boseman stars as the lead detective which is a cool tie to your love of Marvel type movies! Great! I hope you really enjoy it and have a happy holiday! 21 Bridges just released and is a movie I definitely want to see. With all the hype surrounding officer involved shootings it has a lot of interest in my opinion. It's about the opposite. 2 officers are shot in NY and the 21 bridges surrounding the city are shut down as the fugitives are on the run. For sure, thanks. Hello! Can I help you find a movie trailer? One last thing, I suppose. I was also considering seeing Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.Do you think 21 Bridges would be a better movie? Yes, please! I want to see a movie over the holidays and I'm curious about what you might suggest and I'm looking for a recommendation. Awesome. Like I said, I like action films and I typically like nerdy films like Star Wars or Marvel stuff. I like witty humor and banter rather than slap-stick type humor. I like a complex, yet understandable plot. Nothing too out there like Inception or anything."
223,"['Jack the Giant Slayer', 'Bean', 'Incredibles 2', 'Avatar']"," There's the CGI movie Avatar, as well. Jack the Giant Slayer is filmed similar to the LoTR saga. What are you interested in? We were just talking about the Avengers. Like Adventure, Fantasy, but not Disney? Hello. I can recommend pretty much all open levels of movies in the last twenty years or so. Is there something I can help you find? I'm not really sure which Disney movie would fit that... but I found a movie titled Jack the Giant Slayer, which I imagine is kind of like the Jack and the Bean Stalk. And what is Jack and the Giant Beanstalk about? What is it about? Well, avatar would be okay then. I actually don't have the trailer for that. Here's the Google results. When young farmhand Jack (Nicholas Hoult) unwittingly opens a portal between his realm and a race of giants, it rekindles an ancient war. Roaming Earth for the first time in centuries, the fearsome giants seek to reclaim the land they lost long ago. Jack has to face an army of foes that he thought existed only in legend, but through his arduous fight for the kingdom and its people, he may win the love of a brave princess, perhaps becoming a legend himself. Well, I'd like a family move. Something that's happy. Yes, I'm looking for a good animated movie. Okay. I saw Avatar in the theaters. It's very imaginative, creative and awe inspiring. It's a good movie for the kids if they like animated beings and stuff. Also, what's the animated movie with the parents that have super powers, and their kids have them too? It sounds good. Are there any animal as main character movies? I'm thinking about something more for children. I don't know. No, I can do a Disney movie. I don't remember exactly. The humans have inhabited a new planet populated by blue skinned giants. They've developed a technology to suit themselves to conform into their culture and they explore a new world and make friends with the people."
224,['Natural Born Killers']," Great; thanks for asking. I can relate. We are getting snow and some cold weather tonight.

That movie looks awesome, unfortunately I haven't had the chance to watch it yet! Good day, How are you today? Its a bit of a slow burn psychological thriller, but I would say its worth I watch.

It's a bit cold and rainy where I am at, but just working on staying dry lol So what was the last good movie you watched? I am wonderful and yourself ? I went to the movies and saw the Joker.

Yeah I don't really like zombies Gotcha, have you seen the trailer for Booksmart? Have you seen the new trailer for Zombie Land Double Tap movie? You haven't? Well I'll try to not spoil it, but basically its about two girls who just graduated high school who graduated with some pretty high marks.

Some of the new Star Wars movies are a bit complex for my taste. I want something that's mindless and can take me out of the real world for a while."

231,['Zodiac']," Hey friend, how are you today? One of my favorite movies is Se7en, due to the high level of tension involved throughout and I'll always remember how that final reveal at the end made me feel. Just awe stricken. I enjoy comedies, thrillers, and action movies usually. I can go either way in regards to that, although probably prefer a bit of realism involved. Like comic book movies are good, because there based on at least some plausibility. Yes! I like Ed Norton, Chris Evans, Emma Stone, Brad Pitt, & Margo Robbie a lot. I see good movies all the time in my opinion. What types of movies do you like? Doing great, thanks? Have you seen any good movies recently? Are you a fan of a realistic movie or something that is definitely not something that would happen in real life? Are there any actors you prefer I love comic book movies also. Before I give suggestions, what is one of your favorite movies, and why?"

Did you see Terminator Dark Fate? I can't wait to see that myself. I really enjoyed the first one even though the reviews didn't seem so great. Yes I would love a good Sci fi movie or something like the movie ALIENS I think there was Bias due to Capt Marvel SJW flack. I think I will watch The Predator thank you! The Predator was the most recent release they had out. Do you like anime sci fi? Alita Battle Angel was a pretty interesting movie. Do you like horror type alien movies? Do you like animated films? So would you like something like Frozen 2? It's a kids film but it does have adult humor in it. The little snowman in it is quite hilarious. Hello, are you looking for some movie recommendations? Yes I do I love animated films like Akira Okay. Have you seen the new trailer for Rise of Skywalker yet? Yes didn't like it. I want a Japanese animated film to watch. I have seen that one, I'm looking for something current Yes I loved Alita Battle Angel, I am excited they are bringing out a sequel. Yes I do not like that movie sadly. How about a good Sci Fi movie in general? I think I would prefer something along the lines of Japanese animated films. They are more adult and care more for the story then politics. I can help you with that. Have you seen the Alien vs Predator movie or are you looking for something more current? You're welcome. I hope you like it. I see. Have you seen the new Men in Black International movie that came out recently. There's comedy and sci-fi for you. Yes I didn't like the fact they killed John Carter in the first 5 min of the movie. How about something about Predator that is recent."

234,"['The Hateful Eight', 'Hostiles']"," Go ahead. I have not seen this movie. The Hateful Eight it's pretty violent, it takes place in the winter probably in the 1800s in the wild west. A John Wayne western, McClintock. Great! What was the most recent action movie you saw? The western genre is interesting to me. I don't like graphic violence, which is why I tend toward the older westerns. I have heard of it, just not seen it yet. Is it extra violent? Mostly older ones, some newer ones have been good also.

It's a Quintin Tarantino Movie Action movies. Do you like just old Western movies or more modern ones as well? I'm ready to make a recommendation"
235,"['Shutter Island', 'It Comes at Night', 'popular']"," You're welcome. That sounds great. I actually think I'll watch it tonight!! Thanks for the suggestion! Yeah, I totally understand that. I definitely think psychological thrillers are great. Have you seen some of the very popular ones, I don't know, like Shutter Island for example? I also enjoy some romantic comedies, but not ones that are too fluffy or high school ish Great, thank you. I like a lot of different kinds of movies. Not gory, but suspense is great. I don't mind psychological thrillers but not slasher or horror movies. I also really enjoy period movies like Downton Abby and that type. Actually no, I haven't seen that one. What's the basis of that? hi Oh, that sounds good too. I have watched a couple of other virus type movies like that. Survival and everything...they're good. Thanks for the recommendations. I'm going to check out both of those. That's awesome. That's awesome I'm here to help you look for a movie that may fit your interests It's also really good. There's a bit more blood in that one, but only briefly. And it isn't like the gory slasher kind of blood scene Hello Have a great night!! Any other suggestions before I go? It's about a detective who is investigating a missing patient at an asylum on an island No, I haven't seen that one either. What's that one about? I wonder if I can find Shutter Island on Netflix. Is it more sci-fi? Or detective? That sounds good...right up my alley. Not too many blood and guts? No, definitely not. There's very little of that. Like, you see some guy get beat up a bit for one scene, but for the most part it's all about the story and dialogue. It's a great movie. No, not really. But Shutter Island is also a bit older. Have you seen It Comes at Night? So maybe a little more sci-fi, but not too much. The setting of the movie is after some disease has unfortunately wiped out most of the population. There is no real form of government, so people are looking after themselves and looking out for potential threats (mostly from other people trying to survive). But it's really more so from the perspective of this very shielded/protected teenager"

I'm looking for something sort of action-y, but with an intelligent plot and some comedy. I really really liked RED and RED 2, for example. Yeah! I like what I see so far plot wise... but I also see it's kinda lowly ranked on Rotten Tomatoes. Perhaps something with a higher rating but similar in style? Yeah! I saw it semi recently and it was pretty good. Good recommendation! Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer Excellent! Diane Kruger gives a quietly intense, steely performance in this action thriller. Un-related, but I watched Jojo Rabbit in theaters. I enjoyed it Okay, What is the last movie that you watched? Great! Have you seen Domino yet? That was a difficult scene. I remember you said you like spy and action movies. The Angel has fallen is about Secret Service Agent Mike Banning, played by Gerard Butler who framed for the attempted assassination of the President. It also has Morgan Freeman in it. Similar would be cool. Spy movies are awesome! Do you want a movie with similar story or a different one? Oh yes that movie was pretty funny. I enjoyed The Operative. The plot was innovative, nuanced, and entirely credible. How does that sound? It was funny, but it also was sad. I hated that Jojo's mother died. It looks really cool. I accept the recommendation! I have not! It looks right up my ally plotwise, so despite the low rotten tomatoes rating, I accept the recommendation!"

I feel exactly the same about the Shining. Though I don't know much about Rose Red, it sounds great too. Hi there - I am a big fan of fantasy and horror, Stephen King, etc. Got any recommendations? I love the Shining, but of the recommendations, right now, I think I will definitely stick with IT. Any others you think I may like? Oh, I like the IT.

I am great just watching tv... Seen any good Movies lately? What other Julia Roberts movies do you like? Yes! I recently watched Wonder. I love a good feel-good movie. I liked her in Ocean's 11, and Runaway Bride, but Erin Brokovich is probably my favorite of hers. I'm doing well! How are you?"

How are you doing? Awesome to hear! That's not too old. People give Zac Efron a lot of flack, but I think he's usually a good fit for a comedy. Doing fine. My first task here. Just living my life best I can. Yeah, I'll definitely be willing to hear your recommendation(s). A series actually. Rocky, watched all of them just because I enjoy rewatching them. Sweet, I'm more of a rom-com kind of person as well. Would you like to watch a movie that is a romantic comedy? Hi there! I'm here to assist you with finding a movie! That's great to hear! I love it, I'm trying to do that as well for the new year. What was the last movie you have watched? To All the Boys I Loved Before is a very sweet film with some cute comedy involved. It's a Netflix original that will have your heart melted and also, tears from laughing so much. I remember watching this with my partner and it really was enjoyable for the two of us. In addition, Noah Centineo is an upcoming actor himself. I've been seeing him in a couple of shows and movies after watching this one! Any other movies I should check out? Another movie to definitely check out is, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. It is a bit older than the first one I recommended, however, it is star-studded with Zac Efron and Adam Devine. It's almost a given that it will be another great movie to watch as Zac Efron steals hearts and Adam Devine has a huge comedian side to him. Super cute and funny to watch! Not necessarily, though I do enjoy it. I'd say romantic comedy is my favorite next to scifi. That sounds like it would be up my alley. Thank you for taking the time out to explain what the movie is about and your recommendation. I will most definitely be checking it out! Right? I agree as well, he actually is a versatile actor. I know Zac Efron is a great actor in most of the romantic comedies he's in. But he also shows multiple sides to him in some of his action and suspenseful movies. I think Zac Efron is underrated for the wrong reasons. Oh, that's very nice! Sylvester Stallone is an amazing actor. Is action your favorite type of genre for movies? I've seen Adam Devine in Why Him? which honestly was one of the funniest movies I've seen."
264,['Split']," probably ronin, how about you? Recent ones, I have seen Get Out and Us, have you seen either of those? They're horror films, directed by Jordan Peele Oh cool.

Yes; I was about to describe it! enjoying a quiet day. I think my favorite movie would be Catch Me If You Can. Have you seen it? have you seen get out?

I like James McAvoy and I really like that trilogy of films with Unbreakable and Glass. I don't really like any of the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw films, either. I'm more of a fan of psychological thrillers. Yup! I love his movies. If you have Netflix definetely watch, In the Tall Grass. It's super trippy and keeps you guessing even after the film is over. I had to look up YouTube videos that explained the movie. LOL Yup! First what kind of movies do you like? Action, drama, superhero, etc... Really! everyone i know has been recommending me that movie. I just haven't watched the trailer plus I don't know what is about. Hi! Could you recommend a movie to me? It's a fantastic film about aspiration, greed and the perception of power in the world. It's a Korean language film, and was the first foreign film in history to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. I really like suspense and drama movies. The last great suspense movie I saw was Parasite. It was a really great blend of dark comedy, suspense and drama. Now i want to watch it! Since you like suspenseful movies, I recommend watching Doctor Sleep. The film is dark but has funny aspects to it. Plus its the sequel the original, The Shining. Hello I'll check that one out, too. Thanks again! I'm a big fan of Steven King and I loved The Shining. Thank you! I'll definitely watch it. No problem. I'm a huge movie person. I like almost all genres except gruesome horror like the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw. I can't handle those. I like thriller more just because it keeps you thinking. Since you like suspense i also recommend watching Split."

Anything else you can recommend if we need a back-up plan (we live in a college town, and sometimes movies get sold out quickly.) Yes. I accept. Show me the trailer. Well, I wasn't able to find the movie trailer for Birds of Prey but I've selected the Suicide Squad trailer for you to watch. It has the main character of Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn, in it as well. It should give you a good idea of what to expect with the new movie. Does that work for you? Awesome! Action movies are my favorite genre as well. What was the last action movie you saw in theaters? I am! My husband and I enjoy watching together - usually action-based. Inside that genre, we're pretty open though - thriller, comedy, sci-fi - we enjoy most movies that move fast and keep us on our toes. There aren't many superhero movies out right now, but you might enjoy Birds of Prey. It's a comic book based movie starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. These aren't Marvel movies but most people that enjoy the Marvel series enjoy these as well. Would you like to see a movie trailer? Of course - lol! What do you think of the new Black Widow movie coming out? I know my hubby is really looking forward to that one! Perfect. Here's a little background information on the trailer: secret government agency recruits some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force. Their first mission: save the world from the apocalypse. Hi there! I hear you're a big fan of movies I've enjoyed all the Marvel movies. Plus it's about time Scarlett Johansson got her own super hero movie. But since it is not due out for a couple of months would you be interested in watching a trailer for Bad Boys for Life? No. I enjoyed the first one though. It should be entertaining. I like most of Will Smith's work. Are there any other super hero movies out now? We may catch Bad Boys for Life at home sometime, but the Marvel movies tend to have more depth, some unexpected plot twists or character shifts. Bad Boys is pretty straightforward, and while it's a fun trip, it's one we probably won't pay to see in theatres. If you liked the first one, I would definitely recommend watching the new one. I think it was as good as the first and better than the second. Fast paced action and, of course, lots of explosions. Super hero something...I don't quite recall. We usually watch at home since we have a son on the spectrum and a huge TV to accommodate our movie enjoyment. Yeah I know what you mean. Getting out to the movies is tough with kids. Have you seen the new Bad Boys movie with Will Smith? Sure. She was an interesting character. I'd like to know more."

Yes, DeNiro is the lead, also with Al Pacino and Joe Pesci Ok, this is one of his newest films.

289,"['Sherlock Holmes', 'Dark Days', 'dark', 'Genre', 'comedy', 'Some Like It Hot']"," Definitely could have! Also recently watched that. Do you have a favorite director? Ha, at the very least it would be interesting. Lay it on me A real throwback, have heard of it, but never seen. I accept your recommendation Mob movies? Very specific, but cool! Older ones or new takes on the genre? Interesting, I'll check it out. What did you study at university? Awesome! I had an entire month-long intensive course of sorts on Billy Wilder while I was at university. Interesting guy. Hey, how it's going? What kind of movies are you into? Creative Writing BA, Film Studies MA. Currently doing lots of travel and eventually want for one stream of income to be teaching World Cinema courses, even if just at an adjunct level and combined with other income. Do you like it when there is a bit of comedy thrown in or does that ruin it for you? In the genre? Not really, big on Tarantino and Wes Anderson but think theyre a bit outside this scope Either/or as long as they're good. Goodfellas is one of my all time favorites You have piqued my interest. What would be the title of this elusive film? Nice Oscar-winner for ya! But one that many still haven't heard of. In my experience, at least. The Front Page. He contributed to the Sherlock Holmes canon with a good entry as well... Hi! At the moment I'm on a mob movie kick An Anderson gangster film would be...an awesome combination in my opinion. Some nice pastels lining the dark alleyways. Anyhow, I think I have a suggestion! Particularly if you like comedy as well and don't mind the gangster side of things being more of a side plot element. Anything else of his you would recommend in particular? Some Like It Hot. That's awsome! If you could teach on one genre/region of film what would it be? No, comedy is good. Actually recently watched The Departed and thought it could have used a bit of comic releif"

292,"['classical', 'Black Panther', 'super hero']"," Do you like action at all? I recent movie that I saw was 1917 for example. It recently came out. That one blew me away. Have you ever seen black panther? It is not classical, but it highlights that the main character can overcome difficulties and has a happy ending haha. I have not seen that movie yet. Is it your typical superhero movie? I also forgot to ask what the movie 1917 is about? I am doing great. How are you? I really like most movies except horror or overly romantic movies that have a lot of rated R content. Some of my favorites include historical and romantic comedies. I like happy endings...They make me happy haha. I am doing very well. I hope that you're having a good morning. I was wondering what kind of movies do you like? Hello, how are you doing? I have been interested in watching the Black Panther movie but was a little put off that it was another superhero movie because they have been making so many lately. If it is unique, I would be interested in watching it to see what makes it different. Thank you for the recommendation and I accept it. 1917 is a movie where a young man has to send a message to his brother during the great way in 1917. If he doesn't send the message to his brother all of the soldiers with his brother will die. It was very historical and interesting. Black Panther is a unique super hero movie and really interesting. That is a classic. I saw that a long time ago. I wasn't sure what you meant by historical, but you meant movies that are more classical? I have some recommendations that are coming to mind. I agree. I don't like those kind of movies where the main character dies. What about movies with a happy ending? Oh, wow. That's very similar to the kind of movies that I like to see. Have you seen any movies recently? Well you mentioned that you enjoy historical movies, and those are ones I know a lot about actually. I used to review them. What is your favorite historical movie? Honestly, I work with children so I saw Frozen 2 with one of them. I also watched the new Aladdin movie a couple of weeks ago. I haven't seen one of my favorite kind in a while though. Do you have any recommendations? I believe that it is also historical because of the time period in which the movie takes place. I do like classic movies too though I do sometimes like action but war movies where the main character dies make me mad. I am willing to hear your thoughts though. I like The Scarlet Pimpernel. That is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE!"

I would stick with the ones of the first four or five of the series, as they are best. Hello You should start with the first movie to get you started I am glad that I was able to recommend a movie for you. Why do you choose Christmas Vacation?"

The movie kind of addressed some issues that I have been thinking about on my down time as well. What kind of movies do you like? Pretty much the same as you. Have you ever seen Goldengirl? It sounds scary. I might not like it. Not many old films are worth watching, and I have not heard of this before today. It came out in 1979, a doctor tries to make a superwoman out of his daughter. Does that sound like something you would enjoy? No, I have not. I like the Avengers movies and superhero movies in general. I like science fiction and drama."

302,"['Hacksaw Ridge', 'Dunkirk']"," I like to watch movies at home via streaming. Older settings really allow for some creative liberties but the accuracy suffers. I agree. Hello, you have successfully connected.Let's get to viewing! Alright, let's do it! Are you a movie goer or do you like films to come to you at home via streaming? I feel that movies that are more recent are able to be portrayed more accurately. I don't like watching actors fake accents of the way people used to talk before we had audio recording available. I feel like I'm the same way. Why would you say that it? I really enjoyed watching Saving Mr. Banks I understand that, I do tend to have a hard time enjoying films that have won many awards such as The Black Swan, Moneyball, and Hugo. I usually use Netflix for watching movies. Did you see Dunkirk? I do enjoy movies that are surrounding World War II. I also like to watch documentaries. What streaming service(s) do you gravitate towards? I did not see that movie. It's a strong cinematic achievement but harder to connect with on a human level because of the point of view it adopts. Do you like historical dramas? What was the last Netflix film that really grabbed you? I like historical dramas if they are set past the year 1900."

Did the movie have different names in different markets? that big screen is a definite for big blockbusters! i take it action is your thing then? are you into the comic book movies that are popular now? of course! time travel movies tend to fall on the funny or serious side, it sounds like a more serious one is up your alley. edge of tomorrow is with tom cruise, are you familiar with it? what kinds of movies do you see in the theater, versus watching at home? looper is about time travelling to kill people (it's not as dark as that sounds), its a really interesting take on time travel with bruce willis and joseph gordon-levitt. not a spoiler, but joseph gordon-levitt plays a younger version of bruce willis this was a great movie about fighting aliens and reliving the same day (a bit like groundhog day). its called edge of tomorrow, but it was also known as live, die, repeat (which pretty much tells you what its about) Hi Hmm...I like seeing movies with friends in theaters whereas at home I prefer just to watch by myself. Usually in theaters it is a big blockbuster or something recent. I saw looper and really liked it. Looper is a good recommendation. I also liked inception. Are there anymore like that? oh yea! interstellar is a personal favorite of mine. have you seen donnie darko before? jake gyllenhaal is pretty young in it yes, live, die, repeat was the movie's tagline, but went by that name in other markets. in a twist (for tom cruise at least), he initially doesnt know how to fight and hes trained by emily blunt hi! I am not, though I like tom cruise movies. lol. That sounds like a good movie for me to check out. I accept your recommendation. Do you have any others? I really liked interseller and donnie darko is one of my favorite films. Are there others like them you would recommend? Not really into comic book based moveis. More into space or time travel movies."

More like Sci-fi and/or fantasy Me too. It is very expensive, so we also enjoy watching movies at home a lot. In the theater... Star Wars. As a family, we've liked the Star Wars and Harry Potter series. Do you enjoy movies in your spare time? Hi there! I'm not very picky myself. Sorry, that's not a lot of help. That could be! Another one that was very entertaining was Blade Runner. It has Harrison Ford like in the Star Wars movies! One of my kids says that she hates movies. It's kinda annoying and hard to find something she's willing to watch. I kinda gave up, so we watch what we want and she can do whatever she wants to do What's it about? We like sci fi, too!

I thought everyone did a good job acting, but I have seen it already. Maybe one more recommendation? I like comedies as well as dark comedies. My family and I really enjoyed The Hateful Eight starring Kurt Russel as a bounty hunter and his prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) they end up encountering another bounty hunter and a man that claims to be a sheriff. They end up being stuck in a blizzard and as they try to find shelter they encounter a couple other people and soon realize that getting to their destination might not happen. Everything that they encounter and go through keeps you on edge and interested to see whats going to happen next. He really is a great actor. Which of his movies did you enjoy the most?

I understand, its hard to find a funny movie you can actually laugh at. What is the most recent movie you have watched? I guess it just depends on the mood. Action is definitely hit or miss with me, but I would definitely like a recommendation for a romantic movie about love. The most recent movie that I watched was actually El Camino which a Netflix original following the TV show Breaking Bad. Hello there. Hows your day? That movie is much more action packed and suspenseful because it follows the story of a drug dealer. Well that is good. Did you like it more than you would have liked a love movie? Have you heard of the movie Always Be My Maybe? No i have not...is that an American made movie? Doing good thank you. What type of movies do you like to watch? Me too! Hallmark is the best! I dont even care if every movie has the same story. They are just wholesome movies to watch. No i definitely liked it. I thought that the plot was great and the characters felt real. The action was intense but nothing too scary I really like cheesy romantic movies that make you love to be in love. I like movies that are suspenseful but not corny. I dont like sci-fi or super heroes. And i definitely do not like comedies because most of the time they arent actually funny. Is it a love type movie, or more action packed? They really are, I could watch the same one over and over again. Oh wow. Did you like the movie, or was it to action packed for you? Could you recommend one to me? I do as well. I really like old fashion romance movies. But love the stuff on the Hallmark channel as well. I most definitely do!"

How are you? And you mention war movies. Do you like the action aspect of war movies more, or the fact that it is real more? For example, do you also like action movies which are Marvel-based? Its hard to categorize it, but I would say Action or History. It tells a real story in the movie and the story is entertaining and exciting. There is some action involved.

I haven't seen all of them but I watch Iron Man, and Captain America and liked those movies quite a bit. I think I get more out of a movie that seems more real like a Saving Private Ryan but I also like to watch movies that are more fun and imaginative like Marvell as well. Oh, I see! So you like true stories, such as of historical figures of people who have accomplished notable things! I am trying to get the best picture of what makes you get on the edge of your seat when you watch."

I really liked that film. Matt Damon and Christian Bale. We saw it at an IMax. My husband is a sports fan. I didn't think I would like it, but I am so glad I went. I've never heard of that movie, can you tell me more about it? We just saw Ford verses Ferrari. That was awsome! I didn't know that! What actors and actresses are in the film? No, I did not. I don't really like Matt Damon very much. Ford wanted to make a sports car in order to be competitive with other car companies. Did you see Martian? Yes it is. You might enjoy that one. What movies do you like? Do you have any other recommendations for movies that don't have Matt Damon? I like really good sci fi movies, but I do not like action movies.

Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, Christian Bale, Kurt Russell, I'm not super picky though. Sorry, never been a fan of John Cusack. Maybe something else? Perhaps a science fiction film. Glad to hear it.

Love the so terrible its funny type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see Midsommar! It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL. Phantasm just jumped to the top of my list today!! That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list! I love supernatural, vampires are always good too. One of my favorites of all time was 30 days of night. I also like movies that can surprise me. Ones that I think I know the tropes, and something crazy comes out of left field Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like so terrible its funny types of films, Phantasm was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer? Thats awesome! What kind of horror movies do you like? Something more suspense/thriller? Vampire/Supernatural? Gore? 30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently? I saw Fantasy Island just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about Under the Shadow, a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see Brahms 2, but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money. I also saw The Grudge (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol Interesting. Another one I haven't seen that piques my curiosity. Yes please, what is the suspense film that you think I would like? I will say, I was a fan of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter as well. I didn't think I'd like it as I am, honestly, very reserved about gore in horror films and am not a fan. But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it! May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires? I appreciate it! I definitely appreciate the recommendation and I can't wait to watch it! Thank you so much! I enjoyed the chat! Hey there! I hear you're interested in movies. May I ask what kind of movies you enjoy? I'm definitely interested in a few more horro-esque recommendations! Im always up for expanding the list. I'm going to a horror film fest in June, and I want to expand my library quickly:-) Have you ever seen Cursed? Christina Ricci, werewolf movie! Not too great ratings, but I love how they did the werewolves in that. I wish they'd have used similar styles to translate to other popular films! Absolutely! I was looking for a reccomendation acutally. I LOVE horror moview For sure! Are there any other kinds of movies you'd like recommendations for? I have a few more horror-esque flicks as well if you're interested! I haven't!! I think I remember seeing commercials for it, or maybe it was an article online. I think Ive learned I cant trust ratings. That is going on my list to watch tonight too! Im curious to see what you mean about the werewolves. That's something that is always such a hit or miss for me. I do love the werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows though! Two great recommendations!! Awesome!! Thanks so much! It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like the werewolf CGI was pretty well done. And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen Queen of the Damned? Those vampires are something else for sure! I have!! Its one of my favorites:-) I see we have very similar tastes. Any other vampire ones you like?"

Or do you like 'new' horror movies that are more psychologically draining... would prefer the later"
337,['Wings of Life']," I think so. What kind of movies do you like? Hi there, how are you? Have you seen any good movies lately? What did you like about them? I liked it because it enlightened me about things in the natural world that I already did not know. I like learning more about nature and the world around me. Then I can hopefully apply it to my daily life and life a more fulfilled and interesting experience. I like documentaries, films that reallly offer up a unique worldview and new perspective on things. The more out there and interesting the better. What is a documentary that you have watched recently that you enjoyed? No, I don't think so. What kinds of films has he directed? Good afternoon! Have you watched any more from the director of Louis Schwartzberg? I saw one called Fantastic Fungi all about mushrooms, mould, and spores. I also like films that focus on the arts."

I watched the first two alone in my bedroom with the lights off. They had me looking around the room thinking stuff was moving. The 3rd one I saw in the theater which I think took away from the scariness a bit. Something new. I've seen almost all the classics. Exorcism was ok. I recently watched Annabelle, and it was great. Annabelle is great! There is something about possessed dolls that really just kind of freaks people out isn't there? When I was a kid, I was terrified by the Child's Play movies. Did you like those too? Hello! I am hear to help you pick a movie. I liked the Paranormal Activity movies too. They made a bunch of sequels, and they were all reasonably good and not just a box office cash grab. Sounds great. Thanks for the recommendation. I like spooky movies. What should I watch that has demonic possession themes? Yeah. I know there are three Annabelle movies, should I watch the next two? Certainly, but I have another in mind that is coming out tomorrow. Have you heard of Brahms: The Boy II? Spooky movies are a great choice! Are you looking for something old or something new? It is my pleasure. This particular one also got 6 nominations. I am sure that sequel is going to....kill....in the box office. No, I haven't. Is it a sequel? Ok, I will get that queued up for you. In the meantime, here's the Plot: An American nanny is shocked that her new English family's boy is actually a life-sized doll. After she violates a list of strict rules, disturbing events make her believe that the doll is really alive. What are some of your favorites? Yes that sounds fun. While more horror than scary, I liked the original Saw. The sequels and the plotline just got so convoluted and weird. It is and looks crazy scary. Definitely watch the original first as it will set you up to be terrified in this new one. Would you like to view the trailer for the original?"

I am into funny movies... do you have any suggestions of trailers to check out so I can go to the movies next week? I would recommend seeing Midway if you are into action/war movies. The movie does a great job at illustrating the attack on our country and Pearl Harbor. The actors in the movie are amazing as well. Perfect movie for a night out. ok I would go see an action film I am into funny movies also, which is why I am suggesting maybe seeing a different genre. I have been to the movies recently and the comedy movie selection is poor. I would not want to see you waste your money. What about action movies? good how are you?

Do you know who they are? it is about a newly possessed high school cheerleader turns into a succubus who specializes in killing her male classmates. Absolutely. If you have other horror comedy recommendations I would love to hear them. I like Shaun of the Dead, Dead Alive, Dead Snow, House, etc. The cast are Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, Adam Brody. An amazing cast! Well my favorite is probably horror but I don't care for gore. I also like drama but rarely romantic dramas. I really like gangster and war movies as drama examples.

I'm in the mood for Christmas horror movies and action. Nice! Krampus and Christmas Nightmare are some of my favorites.A nightmare before Christmas is a solid Disney classic if you have never seen it. If you want scarier (that's not animated), go for Jack Frost. For action (and christmas) If you haven't seen Die Hard (there is also a second one), you should for sure start there. It's a classic and one of my favorites all time. Sweet! I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. Don't get too scared ;) I saw it a few years ago back when it first came out and watch it every December. I think I enjoy it because the characters are relatable and the story line has some normalcy to it, but it's high intensity and is in the spirit of Christmas time so also adds to the effect. I will definately watch a Nightmare Before Christmas and Jack Frost. I have already seen die hard. Yet I must leave since I am about to go out and pick up some DVD's. Yes. Hobbes&Shaw, Krampus, a Christmas Nightmare, and Silent Night Deadly Night. Nice! Looking for some good movie recommendations? Yes I am. If you watch it every December, then I am really excited to see it since for me Christmas is all about the movies . My personal favorite is Follow. I love the cast and it's definitely a good thriller that keeps your heart racing for a majority. Oh I will enjoy them since this is how I celebrate christmas.

I'm not sure what's coming up. I'll be happy to send it to you. Enjoy. I saw It Chapter Two and liked it. What can you tell me about Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark? A horror movie will make or break within the first 15 minutes or so for me. I never finish movies for the sake of it but I'm also fairly forgiving about cliche. It is somewhat different because it takes the stories to a deeper level. I think you would enjoy this move. Another one I saw was Ready or Not which was a comedic take on horror. If you want horror with comedy this one is worth the ticket. If you're like me, the unexpected fright that you don't see coming is the best! I agree. If I'm not starting to stress during that time or at least become aware that somethings coming then I've tuned out. Thank you so much! This is a neat adaptation of all of the types of scary stories most of us have heard when we were younger like the scarecrow that comes to life, lovers being stalked while making out in lover's lane, etc. The director gave it a more adult take with lot's of fright. My pleasure to help you with your choices. I don't think I've ever seen that one. I can guarantee that if you love horror you'll definitely want to see It Two. I saw it and it was creepier than the first. Anoter one is Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. Equally scary. The very best film that I believe captured your total attention at the beginning was Quiet. Totally fantastic and unique take on horror. Hi, I'm here to help you pick a movie trailer. There are so many horror movies being released compared to years ago and, happily, the quality has improved. As a horror fan. myself. I'm thrilled. Got it. This will help me give you some to choose from. I look forward to seeing it! I can recognize traditional scare tactics pretty well in this genre. If you have seen enough of them, it gets that way. Hi that's great I'm considering seeing a new horror movie. Do you have anything in mind? I've seen alot of remakes of classic scary stories. For example, the scarecrow as depicted in Jeepers Creepers. Do you think this movie Scary Stories would be different? Can you send me the trailer for the Scary Stories movie you recommend?"

I like romantic comedies best, but I also like movies based on true events. If you haven't seen There's Something About Mary, I highly recommend it. It stars them both and it's really funny, some of the jokes can be a little bit dirty though. I can tell you more about it if you'd like. She's actually super sweet and part of the reason she liked Ben's character in the beginning is because he had a sweet heart and got along well with her special needs brother. She's a bit of a guy's girl when she's older, into sports, beer, etc... Great, thanks for asking! I hope I can find you a good movie trailer. Do you know what kind of movie you'd like to see? Do you like Ben Stiller or Cameron Diaz? Cool! Haven't seen that one in forever. So are you looking for something similar? The Wedding Singer, with Adam Sandler. He's one of my favorites. The music is always great in his movies. Yes! I like that endearing hopefulness, with the really sweet, good guy. You know the kind, where love just sort of sneaks up on them! Ben Stiller was a bit of a dork in high school and manages to get a prom date with a really attractive girl (Diaz), however the date goes awry in hilarious fashion. Years later he gets a chance to meet up with her again and kind of start over. Lots of complications though and the way he goes about it is kinda dodgy, but his heart is true. So is the attractive girl nice or antagonistic in this movie? Does she seem to like Ben or does she treat him as though he's beneath her level. I like them both! They both seem to have very sweet character portrayals. I've heard some really good reviews about that one. I'd love to hear more about it. And I don't mind some of the dirty jokes, in the interest of comedy--I'll just be sure to watch it after the kids have gone to bed. I accept this recommendation. Tell me more about it, please.

Jenniefer was a revelation I've watched it. My girlfriend has a crush on Steve Carrell from his performance in that movie. Romantic comedies are awesome! Have you ever seen 500 Days of Summer? I also really like Crazy Stupid Love because Im a big Steve Carrell fan! It's about a guy having a sort of mid-life crisis after a divorce. I love romantic comedies I'd really like to see it. It sounds interesting I'm doing well. I'm going to try to help you find a cool movie today. What kind of movies do you like? Yeah. It was alright That's one of my favorites. Which one is your current favorite? I'm fine thanks. How are you? Do you have any other suggestion? I love Jennifer Aniston! Have you seen The Switch? We're the millers It came out in like 2007 so it's a little older but it's about this teenage girl who accidentally gets pregnant by one of her best friends, and then how she deals with the aftermath of that. I don't want to spoil it and I know it sounds cheesy but it's actually really sweet and super funny and not at all what you would probably expect out of a teen pregnancy movie. I haven't seen that one. What's it about? Awesome! If you decide to watch it I hope you like it! I totally agree. I love Jason Bateman too, he's such a dad and absolutely hilarious.

John Cusack stars as a professional hit man who walked out on his girlfriend just before senior prom and returns 10 years later for the reunion and to try and get back together with his girlfriend Minnie Driver. He is also trying to reconcile his job with trying to have a normal life. Grosse Point Blanke No, what is it about? Hello, I understand you like movies! I can't stand Adam Sandler movies... which is unfortunate because I love Jennifer Aniston. Romantic or with a good story! I like witty humor. I prefer newer works. It is a classic formula of two people from different worlds finding each other. What is interesting is the actors. Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron. Not two people you would tend to see in a movie together Yes, what is a comedy movie you would recommend? Well this one is a bit different but depends on whether you like Rebel Wilson or not. She stars as a person who hates Rom Coms, gets knocked and finds herself living the plot of a Rom Com. Learning life lessons and finding love along the way. Cool, one of my favorites this year was Murder Mystery with Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler. The formula is the stale couple rekindling their romance but it takes place on a yacht and a murder takes place and they find themselves in the middle of trying to solve it while working out their relationship issues. Do you like old classic films that may be in black and white or do you prefer newer works? One from earlier this year was Always Be My Maybe. About two people whose paths crossed over the years but they never got together as the timing was always wrong and their destinies took them different places OK one of the really good new ones is called Longshot. Have you heard of it? I think she is a bit overrated. I need a witty movie! That one sounds more interesting. That sounds more interesting I guess that's why it's called Longshot. I'm not sure I am interested. Do you like romantic comedies, slapstick, or comedies with a good story?"
382,"['movies', 'Split', 'Get Out', 'Donnie Darko', 'Glass']"," Great! I will have to check that one out too Awesome! Would you like to watch this movie trailer? I know of some really great ones. Have you ever seen Donnie Darko? I haven't. What are they about? Great! I am looking for psychological thrillers, do you know of any good ones? What about the movie Get Out!? Before we finish, are there any other movies that you also be interested in? There are a few others in the thriller category that I think that you would like. Its the sequel to Split, and focuses on the 24th personality being used as a weapon. Ok, thanks again for the recommendation Split is based on the idea that a man kidnaps three girls, but the kicker is that he has 23 unique personalities. And apparently there is a 24th personality that is really horrible that has yet to come out yet. So the girls try to escape before the 24th comes out. I have been meaning to watch that one, actually. I will accept that recommendation! Thank you You might like Awaken, though it is a few years old. The plot is based on a random group of people waking up on an island where they are being hunted down. Oh wow! That sounds creepy and definitely thrilling. What about Glass? Both of those seem like movies I would be interested in. One of my favorite psychological thrillers is Shutter Island. Do you know of any movies similar to that? Sure, I am open to more ideas! Great. The trailer should begin after the chat is finished. I hope you enjoy it. Hi! I am here to help recommend a movie for you today. Yes, sure! I have not! But have definitely heard of it before. I'll definitely have to check that one out, but am curious if you know of any more recent films? There was a fairly recent one that came out called Split, which also had a sequel called Glass. Have you heard of either of these?"

Good day to sit back and watch some movies though. What was the last one you watched? Sure. A movie I am going to check out tonight is The Hateful Eight. I have not seen that movie yet, have you? It's on Netflix as well. Doing well, enjoying a bit of sunshine for once. Yes, it was. I like suspense, too. Can you recommend a good suspenseful movie for me? Hey, how's it going?

Interesting. I have never heard of that movie before, but I'm not really into aliens. Could you recommend a movie to me with humans in it? Maybe something along the lines of government plots? Fast and Furious movies! These have action and drama as well. Some funny parts too. I really enjoyed The Quiet Place. It's about aliens that attack if they hear you.

Now that sounds very interesting. I'm going to take that recommendation. Thank you so much for taking the time to offer me such a great suggestion. I very much appreciate it. Please have a great day!

I mean, there's been mediocre films, but for the most part, I can find a reason to enjoy a movie, even if for the effort or unique premise. I honestly cannot recall the last film I left theaters being upset seeing. You're very open minded! Would you say you appreciate the production value over the acting/script? Hello, happy thanksgiving! Are you into Science Fiction or more into action? It Follows was very good. And I loved the themes of motherhood on Hereditary. A24 has been putting out some really high-quality films this year. I don't mind horror, I just don't care for the ghost/paranormal stuff. I like monsters or slashers. The whole Grudge/Ring crazy and now Annabelle/conjuring craze just doesn't interest me. It's all ghosts haunting houses. I like more creative ones like It Follows, or You're Next. Hereditary and Midsommar were both fantastic. I believe Terminator. It's been somewhat of a down year for me. The movie was solid, but nothing special. Pretty much anything from 2000 on. That's when I started watching them. I haven't seen their Netflix film, Buster Scruggs, but everything else has been a gem. No Country has some of the best cinematography ever. Is there any movie that you've disliked? Any pet peeves? I'm open for anything. I'm not picky whatsoever. Hey, you too. Oh I've heard of that. Coen Brothers have made several outstanding films. I may have seen this when I was younger, but I legit don't remember. I'll check and see if it's on any streaming. Awesome! What other Cohen brother movies do you like? I would recommend checking out Raising Arizona if you haven't before! Its a very creative and heart-felt comedy about an ex convict and his wife raising a baby. The plot sounds simple but the script is really good, as is the acting. If you're a fan of Nicholas Cage, this is one of his best performances. Yea, them and blumhouse tend to put out quality film after quality film. Check out Midsommar if you can, it's 2.5 hours, but fantastic. They both play important roles to me. A boring concept with great acting can make a decent film as much as a very unique plot with mediocre acting. Like Godzilla is giant monsters fighting, acting doesn't really matter there, or something like Hateful Eight is a half dozen people sitting in a room and talking for 3 hours, yet it was thrilling."
398,"['Silent Hill', 'Event Horizon']"," Anything stand out for you, in terms of what you liked or disliked about it? I liked the fact that the woman is a psychic/medium who went back to her childhood home to get rid of the evil that she released. She found out the secret of many bodies hidden in the house and her dad was a part of it. I disliked how it didn't scare me or make me jump like I would like horror movies to do. Hi! The last one I saw was Insidious: Last Key. Hey It still sounds like something I'd enjoy. I like horror a lot too. The scariest movies I've ever seen were Event Horizon, Silent Hill and the original Nightmare on Elm Street. Have you seen any of those? I have seen Silent Hill and Nightmare on Elm Street. I don't remember if I have seen Event Horizon. The name of the movie is familiar, but if I have seen it it has been a long time. I do love the serial killer type movies too. My favorite is Michael Myers. He's my favorite. What kind of movies do you like? I love Horror Movies. Also I like Action, Thrillers and Drama. What's the last horror movie you saw?"
399,"['Nolan', 'Interstellar', 'sci-fi', 'directed', 'fantasy', 'Memento', 'director', 'Christopher Nolan', 'Stanley Kubrick', 'Inception', 'The Prestige', 'thriller', 'The Dark Knight']"," Yeah I've seen it! Oh, alright. So, I am thinking about something that maybe is thought-provoking but also has fantasy elements. It's a mystery thriller about a man with amnesia, more or less. The movie is shown in a very unique way where it goes back and forth between present time and flashbacks as the man comes back to remembering these times. My description doesn't make it sound very interesting but I really enjoyed the movie. It was one of Nolan's early movies so it's often overlooked and there aren't any big name actors in it but it is a very interesting premise and I'd recommend it if you like movies that make you think Huh, really? Well, not that one either, what is it about? No, it's I'm not into that. Oh, that's okay, I get that. When I said Interstellar, you seemed excited, so the movie it was partially inspired by might be a good movie for you. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a pretty old movie, but it's definitely a classic, it's a sci-fi space movie and is quite a bit similar to Interstellar Oh yeah that movie is great. The only other Nolan movie I can think of that I've seen that fits what you like would be Interstellar. Have you ever seen it? Alright I accept your recommendation. Awesome, the movie that first came to mind and now stands out the most has definitely got to be Inception. It's all fantasy and really makes you think about how they're doing what they're doing in the movie. I thought it was a great movie. I'm not going to spoil anything for you. It's got so many good actors in it, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cane, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, and several more big name actors. I like those movies. Ok, so, I really like MCU and Pixar movies. I can't seem to find a trailer for this movie. Have you ever seen Memento, also directed by Christopher Nolan? So you like more superhero and/or a decidedly good vs. evil kind of though provoking fantasy? Doesn't have to have be good vs. evil, I also enjoy something with an interesting premise but doesn't throw it away in the middle of it. Christopher Nolan is definitely my favorite director because all of his movies are thriller type movies. Have you ever seen his movie The Prestige? Not yet, but I'm intersted. Hmm, do you have another Nolan movie in mind? Since you like MCU movies, I'm assuming you've seen The Dark Knight trilogy, but if not I'd really recommend those even if you aren't a DC fan. I can't really think of any other Nolan movies that I've seen that you would be interested in. Did my description of Memento make it seem not interesting? I haven't seen that one yet, I heard it's good. What's one movie you liked that was similar to this? Hi, I'm here to help recommend a movie for you."

404,['Truth or Dare']," I agree. think that also includes the special effects when something looks fake, i think it ruins the entire movie. I love movies that make me jump and just can't look away.

Are you a fan of Oscar-nominated films? that is good Black Book is a 2006 Dutch war film with a very similar tone to Tarantino's films. It's witty, insightful, violent, and sexy.

414,"['Blade Runner', 'Keanu', 'actor', 'Knock Knock', 'Hitchcock', 'John Wick', 'play']"," Despite it's faults, I really enjoy the original Blade Runner. It has a fantastic atmosphere. Yeah, they don't make movies like they used to. It's probably not the last science fiction film I've seen, but the one that comes to mind first is Blade Runner 2049. Never been a fan of Ewan McGregor to be honest. Cool, so pretty recent, surprised I never heard of it. Any other actors of note in Replicas? Yeah, Keanu Reeves is great! What is Replicas? I don't think I know that one. Hello, how are you? He is the main role it is similar to x-files and a mix of matrix. Cloning. i really like it and i think you would. you should check it out. awesome. no one would ever play john wick better than him btw. i wish they had him in deathwish rather than the other guy from die hard which film have you seen recently? i love that genre also You are most welcome. lol :) Do you like movies and if so which genre? i agree. everything is a remake. they are even trying to remake now Hitchcock's films. which we both know will ruin the films. I love Blade Runner. Especially more older films Ha, I never watched the new Deathwish. I've seen some of the originals and even those were done to death by Charles Bronson. Would be great to see Hollywood embrace more original ideas instead of drudging up established IP's because of their noteriety. I love movies. Science fiction is probably my favorite, followed by action/drama or action/thriller. I recently found out they already redid Psycho a few years back, I was shocked. Sounds interesting. Is it a newer film? Better than some, worse than others. Thanks for asking! Replicas sounds great, I feel like Keanu Reeves has been everywhere recently, but I only recall seeing the him in John Wick films as of late. I'd love to see the trailer for it and check it out. No, I haven't seen any of the Purge films. Going to check out Replicas though, thanks for the recommendation. Take care! If they had Keanu Reeves it would have been better. The ain actor ruined the film. Speaking of Keanu I loved Replicas. 2018 byt anything this guy makes is really good. he is under rated in my opinion. he would have been awesome in the newer version of the shining rather than ewan mcgregor. yea that was not the same. back then they had great actors that didnt need technology to pull you into the film. have you seen the purge? me neither. a bunch of unknowns which makes it better and he tends to make those types of films anyhow. But John Ortiz has made some films for drama"

Got it, I think I have a couple options you might like. When you watch a movie, do you often also watch the sequel if one comes out? I don't think I've properly watched 7-8 to give an appropriate review. Greetings, I understand you are looking for movie recommendations. I would, actually. Thank you. The last movie I saw was Zombieland: Double Tap. One I might recommend is Joker, it is a type of sequel, but really looks to look peer into a character from a different perspective. Good question. Some days I like sci-fi & fantasy, others I like drama. Well, it is not quite out yet, and it is the umpteenth release in a series, but if you've seen all of the initial Star Wars movies, I would recommend the trailer for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. With the Star Wars series being what it is, I find it will be a must-see movie as someone who appreciates Sci-fi. As a Sci-fi fan, I had presumed that you had. You mentioned seeing the original trilogy multiple times, how do you think episodes I-III compare with the originals. That is seemingly a heavily debated question... I'd have to ask. The original trilogy feels like a more ambitious feat, for when it was made & how. It depends. I think with how frequent sequels have become, I've lost interest in keeping up with watching the sixth, seventh, etc. iteration of primarily the same story. I would agree. How do you think episodes 7-8 compare with 1-3? What types of movies are you interested in? Since you've already seen it, would you like another recommendation? Yes, I am. What do you recommend? Star Wars has been a series I've kept up most with, repeatedly watching the original trilogy as a child. I will definitely check it out."

464,"['Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales', 'tales']"," ok. i have a movie to recommend. how about pirates of the carribbean. I'm comfortable with that recommendation as I haven't watched those in several years and it would be fun to re-visit them. Hi, how are you? I'm curious to hear if you have a recommendation for a movie. That's great. Thank you! pirates of the carribbean lol i can recommend some documentaries. what kind do you like to watch? oh I see. do you like action or horror movies? ok. i will recommend one of those movies. how is pirates of the carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl The last great movie I watched was Midsommar. I'm a huge fan of Alamo Drafthouse Movie Parties because often times the plots and themes seemingly have all been done before. sure i have some movies to recommend for you. I just need to know your preferences. hi, how are you? History. Pirates. Tales of the ocean/boating/island life. Wasn't there a 3rd Pirates of The Caribbean as well? I get them confused. Dead Men Tell No Tales or something like that? your welcome i just recommended it. I've seen all of those and the one with Keith Richards was my favorite. Truthfully I am a documentary fan. Just a splash of sci-fi or horror. Midsommar to be was more of a really unusual acid trip (lol!) than a horror IMO. ok. do you want me to recommend that or something else. Is there any other similar movie you can think of off the top of your head?"
465,"['Untamed Heart', 'The Shining', 'Love, Simon', 'Long Shot']"," I think Untamed Heart would be a great one for you. Oh cool, thanks! I get freaked out by horror movies, but what are your favorites? I am a big horror fan. There are a lot of good romantic comedies I can recommend though. I saw that one over the summer, it was great! What kind of genres are you interested in? What is that about? Is it in theaters? I think you might like Long Shot from 2019 Oh wow, what is it about? Hmmmm that sounds interesting. But if we are looking for something more current, what would you recommend? Hi! Yes. I'm looking for a movie to go to with my family this week. What do you recommend? I love Romantic Comedies. My family tends to enjoy comedies, action movies and period movies. What do you like? I love classic ones. I like The Shining (1980) and An American Werewolf in London (1981) It is not in theaters. It came out in the early nineties. 1992 I think. Hello. Are you interested in any trailers? It is about a man who falls in love with a girl who works at the same restaurant as him Hmmm. I've never seen either of those. What Romantic Comedies do you recommend, if any?"
466,"['Big Business', 'Lawyer', 'dramas', 'The Notebook', 'The Lincoln Lawyer']"," You're welcome It's about a fixer for a law firm, and he is assigned to a multitude of tasks where he utilizes loopholes and connections for his employers. It stars George Clooney, and was nominated for a number of Academy Awards. That is one I have thought about watching before but I never have. Do you think that is the best of the ones you've suggested? Have you seen the movie Michael Clayton? I would suggest another movie Erin Brockovich if you have not seen that one either. Being based on true story on true story about a small town woman can win against a corporation Romcoms are ok but maybe something in a drama or thriller would be more to my liking. I have seen that but it was so long ago I don't really remember much about it. I might have to see it again. Do you have anymore? Maybe one more? Do you have maybe another one since that one seems good? A classic would be The Firm that stars Tom Cruise, based on the novel of the same name. It focuses more on a scandal of a law firm, but still has some great drama and thrilling elements I have seen that one and really liked it. Know of any others that are similar? Are we talking dramas like The Notebook? or Michael Clayton? I would suggest romantic comedies, because they usually have a feel good story while letting you laugh. How does that sound? I am pretty open to a bunch of different genres. What would you suggest offhand? Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer More like crime or courtroom type dramas. Wow, that sounds like it could be really good.I think I'll give it a go. I accept your recommendation. Thanks No I have not. What is it about? Lincoln Lawyer is one of my personal favorites, probably due to the theme of loyalty that is all throughout the film. Have you seen that one?"

I do feel that this one is the best adaptation of all of the Dolittle movies. Have you seen any of the older ones? It did not have the original cast and the music just didn't have a spark. I understand! Have you read anything about the new Dolittle movie? It just recently came out in January so is relatively new. If not, what is it about that movie that disinterests you? Not sure if it was the original or not, but it was the musical one. I actually liked it very mucn but I like musicals. They don't have many of those anymore. Mama Mia was good! Like most movies they should quit while they are ahead because the second one wasn't so good. Same thing happened with Grease. I last saw Little Women. It was good. I liked most of the actors. Maybe now I'm looking for something with a little more adventure. Animal movies are good too!.....not cartoon tho. Well, I'm not into science fiction at all. Historical fiction is a favorite. Not really wanting to see something sad. I don't like a lot of violence and language. I guess I'm in the mood for a feel good movie. Dramas are good too as long as the plot is interesting. Agreed! I was disappointed by the second Mama Mia as well, but know some who enjoyed it. I never did see the next Grease- what did you not like about it? It is! It is rated PG, so a little more geared towards children however it combines action & adventure with comedy- a feel good movie you might say! Hey! I think that is a great idea! As long as it's not rated G, it works for me. Not a fan of sitting in a theater with a bunch of little kids. I do like me some Robert Downey Jr! :) I will take your recommendation! Thank You! I have read some books that were made into movies that involved animals. Like A Dog's Purpose. Very well done,but that was a while ago. Just thought there might be something similar out. There are all kinds of things out right now- what kind of movies do you like to see? Are there any genres that you don't like? Little Women was a great movie! The costume design in the movie was well thought out and totally deserved to win the academy award for best costume design. I also enjoyed the score of that movie. Can you expand a bit more on what you mean by animal movies, especially since you said you don't care for animation? Yeah the other ones are pretty old and not my favorite to be honest. Did you ever seen the original one? It won a bunch of awards back in the day! I see! I also enjoy feel good movies and understand what you mean about dramas- sometimes the plot can be a little lacking! What is the last movie you watched if you don't mind my asking? Yes, I saw the one with the guy from My Fair Lady, but that was a long time ago. Thanks again. Oh yea! I haven't really read anything recently, but isn't that the one with Robert Downey Jr.?nWhat is it rated? Hi there, I understand you are trying to find a movie trailer that interests you? Yes, I am! Do you have any recommendations for what's out there?What does everyone seem to want to see?"

Yeah, if you didn't enjoy the first one I'd stay away from it too. Have you seen STIR OF ECHOES? It managed to stay true to the source material, whilst changing a few key elements to keep it fresh and update it for a new audience I am interested in sci fi movies but horror are also acceptable I dont think I have, Kevin Bacon right? He recommends new indie horror movies to his fans, I'd recommend checking out The Autopsy of Jane Doe. Stephen King provides some thrilling content for movies! Are you a fan of his? I will check out a trailer for it thanks I accept this recomenndation I didnt know that he did that, what kinds of movies does he reccomend Yes! It's a supernatural film based on a novel. I remember you said you like sci fi movies and this is based on a novel like Stephen King so it could be a good one to check out. Have you recently watched a sci-fi or horror movie you enjoyed?

However, I just watched a trailer and it is one that I would want to see. It is a good recommendation based on what I saw. Ooo those are fun!

What's your opinion on movies about race cars? They are ok, I guess. I don't seek them out on purpose. Not really my favorite. Oh, yes. I do enjoy martial arts movies. I appreciate when there is a little culture or history involved in a movie. How about martial arts? Have you seen Jason Bourne? I am not sure if I have seen it. I like some sci fi too. Any suggestions in that genre? No it is from 2016 Great. I enjoy action movies. I also enjoy drama and maybe a little romance. I would recommend watching The Karate Kid if you haven't seen it yet!

The last movie I watched was Frozen 2 It's awesome! It's about this woman who goes on the hunt for revenge after her a horrible tragedy I would want a different one Hi! That sounds great! Yeah totally. I'm the same way. I love suspense! It doesn't really sound like the type of movie I would be interested in. Do you have any other recommendations? I like action dramas but I have not heard of this movie. What is it about? Ok sure! and just wondering. What was it about frozen 2 that you really enjoyed the most? Ok awesome! Well recently I saw this movie called Peppermint. Do you like action dramas too? Ok got it! And you did say you liked action dramas. What do you like most about those kinds of movies? Hey! I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer Yes the suspense is the best part. Ok great! I'm just gonna ask a couple of questions. What is the last movie that you watched? I like that they keep you on the edge of your seat and they keep your attention during the whole movie. They also keep you guessing about what is going to happen next.

I love watching movies in general and enjoy all genres, but I've noticed one of my dogs always watches the tv when a scary movie is on, haha. Yes it was so interesting to see what was going to happen next! And the ending was pretty surprising! I would say thrillers are my favorite, but I'm not picky about genres! Comedies are great as well! I would say it's more of a thriller. There are some jump scares in it but it's not completely terrifying. It's about these girls that go caving and end up getting trapped in the cave where there are monsters. It's pretty interesting. Are thrillers your favorite genre? I like them a lot but I love a good comedy! I love dogs. I like to hang out and watch movies with my dog. Do you? I am doing great. How has your day been? Yes the music can be very intense! What scary movie did you recently watch that made your dog watch the movie as well? Hahaha, that's hilarious. I think my dog just gets worried about what's happening whenever the intense music starts to play. It was! It's great to see a movie that constantly keeps you guessing until the very end It's been good! I had a pretty good day at work and now I'm just relaxing with my dogs That actually sounds like something I would watch! I like those types of movies! One thriller I liked a lot was Get Out, very psychologic! More into those than blood and guts. Ive never watched that one myself. Is it really scary? I am a big fan of thrillers, like Stephen king movies. Hello! How are you doing? The most recent one I've noticed him watching was The Descent, which is kind of an older movie, but I watch it all the time at home. Get Out was great!

Its the perfect twist of psychological and drama, with a surprise ending! One more thing: if I like Juno, are there any movies pretty close to it? Wonderful. Thank you very much. I would like a movie recommendation -- I prefer dramas with quirky, off-beat plots like Juno, Tully, and Ladybird. Obviously, I like female protagonists too. I dunno ... that doesn't sound like it's within my preferred genre. What else you got? What is it?! Good afternoon, how are you doing? I love dramas as well! Juno is a great movie, very funny!! I am going to find you the perfect movie! Great, and you? I've seen that movie a long time ago, but I've forgotten a lot about the plot. I do remember that I liked it. Any other science fiction movies that you can recommend with a female lead? I prefer straight drama, but also well-crafted science fiction, like Alien and Aliens. Okay, let me see it this one sounds interesting to you! The first drama, sci fi that comes to mind Is The Butterfly Effect, it came out in 204, with Aston Kutcher. Its about a man who suffers blackouts during significant events of his life. As he grows up, he finds a way to remember these lost memories and a supernatural way to alter his life by reading his journal.. Im great as well! I have the perfect movie in mind!

I really love Avatar and The Hunger Games, but those are newer so you have probably seen them. Edge of Tomorrow is a really good one, it has Emily Blunt as a head female character with Tom Cruise. Its about a soldier fighting aliens who gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies okay, no worries! I will find something for you!

Its about a group of spies who travel the world to solve missions, it's one of a series of movies starring Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise and Angela Bassett Hello! I am here to help you pick a movie to watch! What kind of movies do you enjoy? Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors of all time. I do enjoy watching action films. They join forces with the CIA to prevent a disaster. Terrorists are attempting to use plutonium to attack the vatican. It has a good plot. Who is starring in this movie? Have you seen the newest Mission Impossible movie? No. I haven't. What is that movie about? When did this movie came out? what is the last action film you watched?"

I agree I thought that part of the movie was exciting. I wish he would have been able to defeat Thanos with Thor's hammer. What movie genres peek your interest? It was a nice combination to give Captain America a more offensive capability vs the very defensive shield. A movie genre that would peak my interest would be horror also. The last movie I watched was Avengers Endgame, I liked it a lot especially the climax at the end suspense would be preferred? Hello! I'm doing well and you?

Drunken Master and other Jackie Chan films are up my alley. Well-choreographed fighting is intriguing to me for sure. I totally get it, the franchises can often bring quality down. Have you by any chance seen John Wick? You should also check out the Kingsmen series, first one was great and second one was kind of ok, but the third one looks much better. I'm fine with either, Star Wars has a pretty good franchise although I can't say the recent movies are great, but I can take or leave franchises compared to standalone films. Yes I have, got the chance to see Chapter 2 and 3 in theatres, looking forward to the next iteration. Hi! What kind of movies do you like? Sounds similar to Taken, but sure, I'll give it a go. It's a pretty gritty action thriller starring Joaquin Phoenix, where he plays a former mercenary who deals with his trauma by taking down a human trafficking network and rescuing the girls they had captive. Would you be interested in watching the trailer? Drunken Master is great, he's got such a cool style of fighting. Are you into franchises or film series (if they're good), or are you more of a standalone film fan? It's better than Taken, much more intense and less by-the-numbers. Enjoy! Nice, so you're a fan well-choreographed combat? Any specific movies or shows besides The Mandalorian? Ok solid that's a great series. What about You Were Never Really Here? I haven't heard about that movie, what's it about? I've heard that, I only saw the first Kingsman and was more enamored by the clothes. Thank you!"

Since that's not out for a bit any chance you have a trailer for a movie that I could see today? If your looking for a good comedy you can not go wrong with the new Will Smith and Martin Lawerence movie BAD BOYS for Life.

I'm also pretty excited for the next Fantastic Beasts series. Have you checked out the kid who would be king? right, i was going to say some other ones, but didn't send it. i think some more darker ones that are on netflix that i really enjoyed was Pan's Labyrinth.

I'm sure you have the same opinon about GOT S8 right? haha Did you get a chance to see the rise of skywalker? hey how are you doing tonight Honestly very bored. Yourself? Actually, no. I remember wanting to see it but never did. Remind me what it's about? i saw it a while ago, but i remember it had some pretty dark scenes and a girl who goes into a different fantasy world. It's by Guillermo del Toro so it has kind of that similar Hellboy-esq creatures but I liked this a lot better than Hellboy same haha, so what type of movies do you like? Yes, it was cute. Was more for my kids though. It could have had.... more to it. Know of any good ones that are streaming? Like say Netflix for example? I've seen every one of them. I'm disappointed with how Skywalker ended. I mean... they're pretty much all dead! I've seen and liked both Fantastic Beasts, waiting for the 3rd. And to hell with whoever decided to kill Daenerys! lol Epic fantasy, historical.... Like Harry Potter, Star Wars and Game of Thrones types. Oooh that reminds me I need to watch the new Hellboy also.

545,"['writer', 'Victorian Farm', 'The Happy Prince', 'Little Women']"," An Ideal Husband is from 1999, and has many familiar faces of actors I have seen in other films over the years. I am shocked I don't recall watching it, but it also seems a good watch with my friend I mentioned previously. I tend to do movie nights often with a close friend, and we are always looking for new things to watch, I know she would like these. Hello! Nice to meet you, I really like movies, all sorts of them in fact! How about you? You are welcome I just watched a trailer for An Ideal Husband this looks like another good suggestion, also The importance of being Ernest sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too. I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw. To be honest that's a hard question to answer, I like all sorts of movies. I am unfamiliar with the Victorian style, can you explain what that is a bit perhaps? I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types. I am quite curious about maybe seeing a trailer for a favorite movie of yours in the victorian style as that would be new to me. Oh I see, that sounds quite interesting I will search a trailer for that! Thank you for the suggestion. Yes, I love movies. I am a fan of Victorian style movies. I am here to assist you with looking for a movie trailer. What is your favorite movie style? Hello Yes...I agree. The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful. We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings. Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s. The Importance of Being Earnest is the play I mentioned. This play can be watched on YOUTUBE. You will find it interesting as a form of a movie/play. My pleasure. Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era. Jane Eyre and The Little Women are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing. Great! Another movie is An Ideal Husband. This was a play written by Oscar Wilde turned into a movie. He is also the author of the play, The Importance of Being I agree with you, it's nice to be able to find comedy in such things, nothing better than enjoying a nice laugh and a good story. Especially with loved ones! Oh, I have not heard of either of those either. I will do some researching on An Ideal Husband as well.Being from the same writer I am certain I would be interested in seeing more of their work."

My favorite type of movie is romantic comedies and I do love movies that make me cry at some point in the story ;-) So...what's your favorite type of movie to watch? Hello! What about Notting Hill? Sorry for the delay! I have a recent romantic comedy that was out in the theaters this past year...it's called Yesterday. Is this one that you've seen? Oh yes I have seen Yesterday but I did really like it and I would be willing to watch again! So I accept your recommendation! Good question. Maybe it wasn't advertised as widely as it should have been. The leading guy, who's adorable, probably isn't considered a big box office draw, like Brad Pitt. It seemed to be more of an independent little art-house type romantic comedy, if that makes sense. Now I want to re-watch it! Did the movie make you tear up? Yes it is not a very popular movie but I very much enjoyed it! I too am always looking for a movie buddy i hope you find one! You could recomend another movie but I am also comfortable where we are - up to you the last movie I watched was groundhog day. Which is a romantic comedy so you could recommend something like that. Wow! I'm really impressed that you saw that movie; a lot of people that I know didn't see it. I did cry at some point in that movie. I thank you for accepting my recommendation! Too bad we don't probably live in the same area, since I'm always looking for a movie buddy! Have a great day! Good Morning! It totally made me tear up! I especially loved the part where he met the other people who also remembered the beatles songs. And when he went to meet john lennon! Oh thats another great movie I don't think I've watched that for about 10 years! Ohhhh, yes. I just got chills!

Haha yes they are! Any time those are in a movie, its almost a must watch! I like most comedies. i dont mind a kids movie a few actors i like are Kevin Hart, Seth Rogan, Amy Poehler, Andy Samberg, Tina Fey Those two movies are actually hilarious, Kevin Hart and the Rock are a match made in heaven on screen! Are you open to comedies catered to children but have humor for adults as well? hmm thats a good questions.

554,"['movie', 'Harrison Ford', 'Call Me by Your Name', 'The Call of the Wild', 'Harrison Bergeron']"," Well I recently watched Call me by Your Name, and it was beautiful; both emotionally stirring, and visually stunning. May I tell you a little about it ?. I typically like action movie! bUt ones that make you think, not just ones with a lot of explosions I have actually seen that one and I thought it was a little boring because it was more about killing time with his daughter. My favorite movie of all time is Jack Reacher thats correct! Can you help? I just watched the movie outbreak on netflix and that was pretty good but a movie I watched recently was 21 Bridges and I really liked that What was the last movie you watched ? either rented of went to the theatre. Of Course ! I go to the theatre alot and see most of what Hollywood puts out there. What type of movie do you think you might like ? what genre if I may ask ?.. what about the new The Call of the Wild with Harrison Ford ? thats a great movie ! Hello from across the miles I think that looks interesting! Ill accept that recommendation! that doesnt really seem like its my style well theres the Kevin Costner movie, Three days to Kill.. thats full of action, as he and his estranged daughter reconcile,, its quite thought provoking,, ;-) so I see you are looking for a movie recommendation? hello!"
555,['Harriet']," I like historical, and horror movies Love that Movie. Michael J Fox is in it. Ok. I do too! what was the latest movie you watched? I watched back to the future, part 2, yesterday I am! What are your favorite type of Movies? yes i am! you are as well? Hello, Are you interested in Movies?

Hello, how are you today? Fantastic thanks for asking! Have you seen any good movies lately? How about ones that might take place in space? Yes, I sure do im great, how are you? What kind of movies do you like? I like all kinds: action, romance, drama."
557,"['Rush Hour', 'Split', 'The Invisible Man']"," I'm finding it difficult to decide on which one to recommend. I've narrowed it down to two The most recent one I watched was The Invisible Man It was really good! The story line wasn't your traditional horror flick. It was sort of predictable but it still had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The story flowed really well and it didn't have a lot of dull moments, which often happens in horror movies. Do u prefer horror movies that have a realistic plot, fictional plot, or doesn't matter? That is a hard one. As a kid, hands down any Rush hour. But, now there are so many good ones. I just don't care to much for the remakes.. like American pie was cool, not the 2,4, or 6th one Did you really enjoy the invisible Man? If so what was it that seemed to have you intrigued? That's true, the remakes are usually never as good as the originals! Well the first, Maggie, isn't based on a true story (as previously discussed) but given our current events with the coronavirus, who's to say it couldn't happen? Lol. It stars some phenomenal and well known actors as well. Okay that's so interesting. What is your favorite movie, in that genre? Do you enjoy horror movies, as well? This was a great recommendation! The plot goes really well with the current sitations! I enjoy the true stories, I have my degree in criminal Justice so I enjoy learning about the cases and psychological aspect. As for horror in general, I'm more of a comedy person. I'm happy to help you with your search to the right movie taller. What type of movies do you enjoy? I couldn't agree more. Great! What was the last horror movie you have seen, at home or in theater? Okay, go for it! I love all kinds of movies, I'm not really into girly like chick flicks but my favorite genre is horror. It doesn't really matter, I feel like it's always scarier though if it's based on a true story."
558,"['Star Wars', 'Black Panther']"," I recently watched Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse and really enjoyed it! Many years ago, yes! I saw the original six growing up, but the new ones didn't interest me too much Ooh, thrillers! I have to admit I am more the type to read the description on Wikipedia! Do you like being on the edge of your seat in a movie, or do you like everything to work out in the end? And are you a fan of the rest of the Marvel Universe? Can you tell me about what kinds of movie trailers you are interested in? Oh, nice! What was your favorite thing about the movie? I'm not really sure. I haven't watched a lot of the MCU movies. Yes, that makes sense! What was the last movie you watched that you enjoyed? Honestly, I think it was just how stylish everything was. You could really tell a lot of love was put into it. Oh yes! I love a good drama or thriller! Hi! Nice to meet you! Absolutely! Thats what I love about a lot of Edgar Wright's movies. Preferably, I would like to not know to not be able to guess the plot from the trailer. Just enough to see if the idea is interesting or not. I haven't seen all of them either, but I also have enjoyed the ones I've watched. Many of the movies have a dramatic appeal-- is that something you enjoy? Hello! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. That makes sense. I did enjoy the ones I did watch, such as the newest Thor and Doctor Strange. Okay!

Netflix is great! We watch movies on there all the time. You can rent it on Amazon Prime, Vudu or Apple. Knives Out is at the theaters and I heard that is very funny. I have not had a chance to see it yet. Yes me too! What is the last movie you watched that you enjoyed? It's pretty funny. I watched it with my teenagers. It's about these three 12-year-old boys who get invited to their first kissing party. So they decide to do some research and spy on the teenage girls next door. You can only imagine how crazy and out of hand things go from there. Pretty good and yourself And it is on the theaters, or do you saw it in a platform? I am glad to hear that How are you today?

Yes, I saw the trailer of Knives Out, but I believe there is some violence in there I meant the last Starwars that was on the theaters last month."

Yes, I watched this movie in theaters on Christmas day. It was an interesting ride. nice. What is it rated? Great! It was a good year for comedy movies. Do you have any age restriction or family friendly preferences? yes i am No age restriction, but something for teens and up please. Hi!

Think about how crazy it must be to try and live a normal life when you have superpowers. Have you seen Avengers: Endgame? I am in absolute agreement. Would you rewatch it again? I really like action fantasy movies like Lord of the Rings and Marvel movies Hi, my name is Drake! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. I would probably watch it as part of a marathon because I couldn't watch it on its own, but yes I would watch it again. What kind of movies are you most interested in? What do you like most about Marvel I like superhero backstories. Sometimes it's fun to see how an ordinary person can become extraordinary, and how they cope with having super powers and the responsibility to protect people but still try to live a regular life. I like how Marvel can tell an in depth story based off dozens of comic books in 2 hours. Would you be interested in watching Ant-Man? Hello! I have seen it and I enjoyed it. Could you recommend an older Marvel comics movie? I have seen it. It was amazing. But also really depressing."
563,"['Star Wars', 'action']"," Well, I would suggest at least the last one, which is Spectre. What other type of movies do you enjoy? Hi! I'm doing well. Do you like movies? Yes it is. The trailers are really good, but it does help to be a fan and know about the last few movies. Make sure you catch it. I do, I am also a big James Bond fan, so I am excited to see the new one. A pretty wide variety if I'm being honest. I tend to lean towards action films; like Pacific Rim and Mad Max: Fury Road. Honestly if a movie involves a pretty woman controlling a big machine, I'll probably love it. Do you have any recommendations? I think the only Daniel Craig James Bond that I've seen was casino royale. There was an older one I saw a very long time ago with a ski lodge? but the memory is very fuzzy. Which Daniel Craig Bond films should I see before I watch the latest one? Hey, how's it going? I haven't seen the trailer for that one yet. Is it still daniel craig?"

I watch a lot of movies. Matt Damon is definitely one of my favorites. I think I will have to watch it again also. I watched the My Hero Academia:Heroes Rising movie the other day. Is it about buying a zoo? Sounds like a comedy It's actually a drama. He's a journalist that loses his wife and decides to quit his job and buy a defunct wildlife park. Yeah. Scarlett Johansson is in it too so there's a little eye candy too. But it's good. Okay, i think i might check that out. Always thought it was a comedy and not a drame. Eye Candy is always good, lol. Did you watch this movie in a theater, or somewhere else? Hello Matt Damon and Christain Bale. Both awesome actors. Well worth watching. I highly recommend it. What was the last movie you watched?

Definitely agree, also the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan are easily some of the best in cinema history. Steven Spielberg is a genius. Do you enjoy super hero movies? I prefer Joaquin Phoenix but Heath Ledger was quite good also. I just thinkg Joaquiin plays a darker deranged character Nice, Joker is a wonderful movie, Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor. I have not seen 1917, what is it about? Hello! Have you seen any awesome movies lately? Yes I have seen Saving Private Ryan some years ago. It was one of my favorites, well acted with a great plot and plenty of action. Cool, between Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix whom do you think is the better joker? Dark Knight, Justice League, Joker Sounds interesting, I definitely have to check it out. If you enjoy movies about war I highly recommend Dunkirk. Yes I have. I've seen 1917 and Joker. I find Super Hero movies too predictable and repetitious of previous super hero movies. I'm glad to hear it. If you don't mind me asking, what are your dislikes about super hero franchises? No, Super Hero Movies not as much, I do like the Batman franchise though. I will definitely take your recommendation for Dunkirk. You'll love Dunkirk, it is about the Allied evacuation of France during World War 2. It's a drama, but there is plenty of action. Have you seen Saving Private Ryan? It is about World War I and two British soldiers going behind enemy lines to save over a thousand of their fellow soldiers.It was very suspenseful. I have hard of Dunkirk but haven't seen that one. I like such movies that are based on history and full of suspense and have surprise endings. I will have to check that one out."
592,['Birds of Prey']," Do you know what kind of movies in mind that you would like to see? I hate when that happens it seems like the sequel is always less exciting than the first. Any luck with the link? Me too I love them. What was the last movie that you two watched? What you liked from that movie? And what you didn't like about it ? The last movie we watched was Ready or Not, which is like a horror movie but kind of funny? Lots of blood and the characters who were the seekers in the movie (they were playing deadly hide and seek) were all idiots, and the girl kept getting away. I really liked how despite it being a scary movie, there was comedic relief scattered throughout. I did not like this one seen where the girl who was supposed to be hiding really hurt her hand... it was really graphic and made my stomach hurt a little... We like both, but I would say that Ready or Not had some action moments too. You asked me about the most recent movie we saw and it just happened to be the most recent. I heard Birds of Pray was good though? What do the reviews look like? Have you seen it? Of course :) okay I sure did I'm sorry about that. So would you like to see that movie trailer of Birds of Pray I remember you said you like action movies but it looks like ya'll like horror movies instead. I think if Zombieland: Double Tap came out first, though, It would be the favorite... Like if the movies were to flip dates our opinions would be different. It sounds like they would be if they were. I'm going to attempt to send the movie trailer again. We both like action movies :) while I'm waiting I want to see what other movies especially comedy do yall like? We saw the sequel to Zombieland recently! I really loved the first one and while the second one wasn't *as good*, I still really enjoyed it! Especially the midcredit scene :P They definitely leave a lot out in the movies compared to some books. Hello! Thank you for helping me.. I am really looking for a movie that my boyfriend and I can watch together. Yes please :) Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one? Can you give me 5 mins before I send it to you I'm having tecnical difficulties. Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer Okay cool. I try not to have high hopes with sequels just as I try to separate books from their movies and pretend they are both their own thing. Yes, a similar one please :)"

To be honest, I'm not really familiar with her other movies. But she was really funny in Bridesmaids. I liked the scene where she's attending her friend's wedding dress fitting because it really made me laugh. It felt like I could really relate. I've seen that one, that is a really funny movie.

Hello, what kind of movies are you interested in? You'll like it. But if I may make another suggestion. Don't Breathe is also great within this genre. This title would be more of a suspenseful, quiet, with lots of scares and a less involved plot. That's a great genre! What are some of your favorite titles? OKay let's find some trailers similar to that. That would be my top pick, but since you've seen it... how about Annihilation? with Natalie Portman? There is a trailer out about a part two of Quiet Place ll Have you seen 10 Cloverfield Lane? What did you like about A Quiet Place? I do accept this recommendation and can not wait to see. Thank you very much! Hello! I am interested in horror and drama, how about you? Yes I have! And loved that movie. I would. It's similar to A Quiet Place but different enough to be interesting so you dont feel like youre watching the same movie again. It's less focused on the quiet elements but features a good bit of mysterious fantasy creatures and a general sci-fi mystery plot I did like the fact about staying quiet while trying to live among these creatures. I can view the first recommendation and look into this other Don't Breathe as the next movie to watch. Thank you so much!"

What time period or era do you like the most. For the historical fiction do you like a violent or more of a story focused movie. The last movie that I saw in the theater was Frozen 2 with my daughter. But I am looking for something to watch on my own. I really enjoy historical fiction. I really enjoy anything from about the 1600's to now. I can tolerate some violent, but I like human interest stories more. The movie is about a time traveling nurse. Would you like me to tell you more. Well that certainly sounds interesting. I would like to watch that. Yes, I can help. What is the last movie you have seen in the movie thearter. Either one is fine with me. Hi! I am looking for a movie recommendation. Perhaps you know of a good trailer I could watch? No, I have not."

630,"['Unbreakable', 'series', 'hard', 'Beast', 'Suspense', 'The film']"," Hello! Can I help you find a movie? What is your favorite horror film? Ok, awesome. Are you looking for something like an older classic or maybe something newer? My favorite horror film would probably be The Shining. It's a unique story that keeps the viewer on edge the entire time. I love that over jump scares and senseless gore. I will do my best to find something you haven't seen! Thank you! If it helps, something that deals more with dread than anything else. Nothing tops feeling dread throughout an entire film! I actually haven't seen that one yet. I also did not know Night made that one. Can you tell me a little bit of what it's about? Please! I'm a huge fan of horror films, but prefer more dread than gore. Do you have any suggestions? It's hard to beat the classics. I love the suspense in Hitchcock movies the best. It's one of my favorites he's done so far. James McAvoy does an mind blowingly good job at playing I think 23 different personalities in the film. Preferably something modern as I've seen most of the classic horror films numerous times already. Agreed! He was truly a master of suspense that only a select few have come close to replicating (Shyamalan, Kubrick, Flanagan, etc.). You know of any newer films that could pass as Hitchcock-ian? How did you feel about Split from M. Night? Did you find it too slow, or did that have the dread you're looking for? 23 personalities! That sounds interesting. Without giving too much away, is he like a villain in the film? He's truly a talented actor but I've never seen him play a bad guy before."

634,['Arrival']," Sounds interesting.I will give it a try. Thanks for the recommendation ! First Man, my favorite space movie of all time. It's about how Neil Armstrong joins the space program, spending years in training and risking his life during test flights. And finally their journey to moon. It's a very personal movie, gives you insight into his life. Very entertaining, pretty much the whole 10 years of moon landing preparation packed in 2 hours of movie. So would you like to watch this movie trailer? Doesn't seem like my style honestly. Do you know of any Sci fi movies featuring aliens you would recommend? When was it released? Adam Sandler has done a great job in this movie playing as a jeweler. He is neck deep in debt and people are always after him trying to get their money back but my boy Adam Sandler spends more money on gambling risking his life along with his family's future. Very tense movie man, keeps you on the edge the whole time. So would you like to watch this movie trailer? Hello, I enjoy Sci-fi and true crime documentaries. What would you recommend ? Do you have any recommendations for space movies? end of 2019, there was this big fuss about how it got snubbed for oscar I was honestly really impressed with Uncut Gems. Its a crime/mystery about a NYC jeweller who has a serious gambling problem. What year was it made? First Man, released in 2018. It's about how Neil Armstrong joins the space program, spending years in training and risking his life during test flights. And finally their journey to moon. It's a very personal movie, gives you insight into his life. Hello there, I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer. Is it entertaining or slow paced?"

I have not heard of it before; I have to add it to my list--I am not super familiar with the wartime genre. However, my friend and I watched Letters from Iwo Jima together a couple of years ago. It's a World War II film, but it portrays the Battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of two Japanese soldiers. It is in Japanese (I am a native English speaker) so be forewarned you may have to watch it with subtitles! Hello! I hear that you are looking for movie recommendations! What kind of movies do you like? No I havent seen that movie but it sounds interesting, The last movie I have seen was Hacksaw Ridge. It was a true story about a man for fought without a weapon I believe during Vietnam. It was a great movie I would recommend seeing. So like an inspirational biography of sorts?

I completely understand where you're coming from. I personally feel the Mystery and intrigue are more than enough to keep viewers on their toes. the last film that i watched was Jojo rabbit. im kind of tired of the marvel movies. i feel like its the same film every time i watch it. i like a movie that makes me think theres going to be more.i like cold endings where the viewer can guess what happens next and it changes on what the viewer sees. like in the grey where he fights the wolf in the end it doesnt show who wins but it is up to the viewer to guess thats good to hear. i probably will end up watching it all. while i do accept the first recommendation. do you have one more for me since we are forced to stay inside for god knows how long? Yes, but not too dark that you cant tell whats going on. Ok I understand. If movies with cold endings are your thing, have you ever seen the film Doubt? The film stars Meryl Streep and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film is about A nun seeking answers to a mystery within the Church. ok great! hey okay some movies get like that. is it a slow moving movie or one that goes pretty Quickly? like with the dark colors and slow moving stroy line you think that someone would fall asleep? im looking to watch one with my GF but she falls asleep often when i put a movie on A little of both actually. would you be interested in watching a trailer? Do you know what kind of movies you like to see or genre of film? sounds pretty good. is it like spiritual mystery of criminal mystery? yeah sure! sounds right up my ally What is the last film you watched in general?

I loved that movie so much, it blew my mind quite a bit! I watched that one recently and really enjoyed it. I've been meaning to watch The Wailing as well. How about The Witch Hey, good. Any interesting movies you see lately? I also really liked Hereditary. Yeah, I think that's a good recommendation. Well, the three you mentioned all sound like pretty solid recommendations. Some recent movies I saw and liked were Knives Out, Uncut Gems and Contagion. I generally like movies with deep characters, an engaging plot and beautiful cinematography. Yeah that's a really good one too. So are you really into horror that relies more on the psychological aspect rather than jump scares? I loved the uneasy feeling that the filmmakers were trying to create. It was also probably the best performance of Adam Sandler's career. Oh yeah, that is a really good one. I've seen it before, but I'd be willing to watch it again. The babadook If you're into some Zombie apocalypse type stuff, I'd definitely reccomend Train to Busan aswell Can you name another one in that category you're a fan of? Oh wow, I've heard Uncut Gems was really good. Whats you'r favorite part about it? (without giving spoilers?)"
647,['Four Weddings and a Funeral']," wonderful, I really think you'll like it. watch the trailer and I think you'll want to see it as soon as possible. Cher and Nicholas Cage are in it. Cher is engaged to Nicks brother, who hasn't spoken with his brother in years. Cher is asked by her fiance to invite his brother to the wedding, as he is leaving for Italy to visit his mother. Of course when they meet there is instant chemistry. One of my favorite romance movies is Moonstruck. have you seen it?

Oh ok this sounds like a movie I would really love to watch. I accept your recommendation. Ok great thannk you so much"
648,"['Sonic X', 'Toy Story', 'toy story 4']"," Yup, I saw The Sonic movie and it was actually really good, way better than i was expecting. Yes! That is good, got some good family time in before you're locked inside for who knows how long. Yes, I remember seeing the first trailer and thinking there was no reason to have it be a live animation. It seems like the only reason that movie did or will do well is because of Jim Carrey! Just like how Ryan Reynolds carried Detective Pikachu. What would you give it out of five stars/ Yeah, I don't really remember a lot about Sega. All I remember is watching the cartoon version! Have you seen any trailers for any upcoming Marvel films, or are you a Marvel Fan. If not, have you seen the new Onward Pixar film? They all mix together really good, plus the dad aka the pants gets into all sorts of shenanigans and its super funny Exactly they carry on their same Avengers likeability to Upward, plus the mom is Julia Louis Dreyfus and she's hillarious too Okay I definitely will go see that then! I just love Pixar and Disney movies because they carry such emotional themes and shocking points that you don't realize in your youth. I actually lost a parent when I was in elementary school, so watching this movie I feel like will just make me appreciate the message and themes they are trying to explain. I have wanted to see it but now I'm scared it might be a little too much, but I will still see it. So sorry about your loss as well. 3.5 out of 5, unless you were a big sega genesis fan growing up than a 4 out of 5 because there are a lot of little easter eggs in the movie. Same here, I'm lucky I took my kids to the movies just in time last week. Oh! That's good! I like her as an actress! I love them in the Avengers! Good, how are you? Hello how are you Yes pixar can do no wrong in my book, they have not missed on any movie. Go see upward for sure plus Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are too funny together! Onward is excellent, if you've lost a parent it will hit home and will awaken emotions. I recommend seeing it, for both kids and adults, kids will love just the fun humor and goofy stuff in it, and for adults the themes in it will keep you interested. I lost a parent as a teenager so it hit hard. I have high hopes for Onward, I've never been disappointed by a Pixar film, so I expect good things. I read a little about the plot and am excited! Yes, on Disney and Netflix! Can't really watch them at the theaters right now. Yeah Jim Carrey carried the movie, he was way carrying the movie! The redesign of sonic was on point, on the cuter side than the original version. I know I love Tom Holland ever since I saw him do spiderman. He is the perfect fit for the role. And you cannot dislike Chris Pratt, its impossible! Was it really? I remember seeing the trailers the first time and everyone was bashing on it! I remember seeing Detective Pikachu in theaters so it might be something close to that type of movie? I'm curious to see it but I want to know the reviews first, haha. Excellent! Watching a lot of movies during this coronavirus time?"

You watching with any kids or just adult comedies? Cool! I am send you a trailer for the first one so you can make sure it's the one for you. It is! I assume you have already seen Step Brother as well. Have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2? I'm not sure why but the combination of Mark Wahlberg's seriousness and Will Farrell's comedy pair up well. That's a shame. They have been so successful doing it I'm sure they'll do it again. Ha! I had the same thought. You seen anything about any new projects of theirs? Yes, Chris Rock, Owen Wilson, Jim Carrey, Will Ferrell, Steve Martin. I'm sure there are others also lol. I'm hoping they keep working together on some other plots. Yes, I agree. I hope so anyway. I actually haven't seen either of them. But since they made a sequel, the first was probably pretty good. Thank you for those recommendations. I will check them out. One I have enjoyed with Will Farrell is The Other Guys. Hilarious cop comedy with him and Mark Wahlberg. I agree! They complement each other well. I have! Do you have any favorite comedy actors? That gives me a good idea. I should check if they have any new upcoming movies together. Yes, I love that one! It's very funny."

Oh indeed, he has a voice and a presence. hello, i am here to help you look for a movie trailer! hey, I like movies with short run times and lots of action. OK. What it the general idea of the movie? Right. James Bond kind of things. Death Star blasting a world type stuff. Morgan Freeman is not a know action star. Does he do his own stunts? So whats the most recent action move youve seen? So, would you like to watch this movie trailer? I doubt he does his own stunts, hes getting up in age. He doesn't do a lot of action, but he is a quality actor ( in my opinion). I dont feel that it is, I really like Gerrard Bulter in this series, especillay teamed up with Morgan Freeman. very credible story line. Not necessarily, they are stand alone films, however i would recommend all of them if you haven't seen them. No. Is it political? Oh i love action movies! Yes, I kind of like Jack Reacher movies. Gerrard is another name not really know for action. have you seen Angel has fallen from the olympus has fallen series?"

653,"['Us', 'Split', 'Glass']"," He's just done Us and Get Out, right? Honestly probably Get Out. The twist was great, and the best friend character was hilarious. I totally get that. I hope he keeps putting out movies in the future. Yeah I plan on seeing Candyman. Do you know of any similar directors or films? Yah I liked that one too. Us was pretty wild as well. Yeah, actually. I've been really getting into Jordan Peele' films, they're great. What's the basic premise of Split? I agree, they are pretty good. Which one is your favorite? Cool, thank you for the recommendation :) I'm okay, what about you? I'm doing good. Have you seen any good movies lately? Okay, I'll check that out, thank you :) Yeah, but I like Lupita too much to think of her as the evil monster that she was at the end lol. That actually sounds like I'd like it. What about Glass? Hello, how are you doing today? No problem Yeah, if you like that one then the next one you watch should be Glass. It is the sequel to Split. Without giving too much away it is about a man with split personalities and one of them is a very dangerous one. I would recommend the movie Split. I has some good twists and is a good watch."
654,"['mystery', 'Netflix', 'Snowden', 'Adam Sandler', 'Jennifer Aniston', 'Murder Mystery', 'comedy']"," Snowden is no longer on Netflix. Can you recommend another film to me? Comedy or spy film? Sounds awesome, I do like spy movies too to be honest. What's the last movie you watched? Hello, how are you? Are you looking for a movie trailer to watch? Okay, sure I will check it out. Have you seen the movie 1917? The cinematography is supposed to be great. No, but I have a couple of friends who went to go see it in the movies and said it was phenomenal! I should check it out if you're recommending it too, I will as a matter of fact. Oh cool. I think I will watch it. I recommend the film Oh Lucy with Josh Harnett that is on Hulu I think. It is about Japanese and American cultural differences. It is a drama-comedy that is good if you like quirky films. It's like the 1990s' Real World that was on MTV but it is like a slow drama reality show with good audio and celebrity Japanese hosts who make funny commentaries. It's great if you want to learn more about Japanese culture. It's on Netflix. Thanks for the film recommendation of The Exception. I will check it out. The Exception is another great movie, it IS on Netflix! It's about a German soldier during the onset of WWII who is sent to see if the Dutch resistance has planted a spy against a German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm. I myself am really interested in war movies and comedies! How about you? No, but I heard is was a Japanese reality show of some sort. Can you explain it to me? I love those types of films! Funny thing is I'm super interested in Japanese culture, I find it so fascinating and some of the game shows they have on their TV are HILARIOUS! Haha, thank you for that recommendation! Do you watch Terrace House, the TV show? I like comedies, both American and International. I also like some spy or mystery films. Well I think you would love the movie Snowden, it has actually been on Netflix before. It is about Edward Snowden an ex-CIA agent who showed the United States all of the vasts amounts of information they have on their citizens. You would love it! Check out the trailer. I started watching Traitors on Netflix, which was produced by BBC 4. It's about a women working as a spy and trying to find a communist mole in the UK right after WW2 Yes, I am.

663,"['directed', 'The Dark Knight']"," Honestly I really do love the John Wick movies, my brother told me about them and I watched all three recently and truly love the detail put in about the story and the detail in the action scenes. Truly one of Keanu Reeves' best movies since the Matrix trilogy in my opinion. I remember I watched it for a college class I think it was political science and I really did fall in love with it. The end is truly one of a kind. OMG no way! that is crazy... I had no idea. You must be good at reccommending movies then. lol I love all Christophen Nolan movies and the Cinematographer he works with is amazing! I dont think i have seen those before, what genre are they? okay, cool. I could be interested in that. Do you have any recommendations for psychological drama genre? I think Memento is a good one with Guy Pearce where he can't form any new memories so when he encounters something new he has to tattoo a form of the experience on him, making the tattoos the title of the movie mementos That sounds awesome, I think I'm gonna watch it. I really like movies like that. Ones with weird twists and good cinematography. Thanks! that sounds really good! Yes, and I forgot to mention that the same director, Christopher Nolan directed Memento too speaking of those movies, and yes I thought the Joker was an excellent film, I love it when you can see the character slowly start to change throughout the film, whether it's improving or succumbing to madness like Joaquin Pheonix was able to do in that move with his character. No problem at all, I'm glad I was able to help, it's difficult to find good movies sometimes it seems. Yeah, did you like the joker? I thought it was really good. I also really liked the Dark Night Batman movies I would say they are action with some satirical humor thrown in at times."

Yeah, it's like a mockumentary about vampires, it's hilarious. Cheesy fantasy works for me, or anything with Taika Waititi, honestly. Well, with the virus, I'd love something a little more lighthearted I guess. One of my favorite movies is What We Do in the Shadows, so do you know anything in that vein? That's the vampire movie, right? Do you want to stick with lighthearted vampire fun, or just cheesy fantasy in general? Sure, can you give me a recommendation?"

669,"['Netflix', 'Inside Out']"," Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Richard Kind are among the cast Would you happen to know if either of these films are currently offered on Netflix? I personally feel that it is very important that children know that it's okay to 'feel' different ways. I'm leaning towards watching Inside Out first. What year was that released? I would say so. In my opinion, Inside out shows children that it is normal to have crazy mixture of emotion during stressful times. The key is to have good communication with people you trust. Coco shows the importance of family and tradition. That sounds like an excellent recommendation! Thank you! Hope you have a nice weekend, goodbye :) Inside Out is an animated movie by Disney, It's definitely family friendly, not really a comedy Amy Poehler is a hoot! Would you say their are morals/lessons learned targeted towards children in one or both of these? Hello friend! No, I haven't seen either one. Any actors I would recognize in Inside Out? Is CoCo animated as well? Yes, it is. Sure, have you seen Inside Out or CoCo? The creators have made another movie coming out soon. I agree. It was released in 2015 I really like the movie, very easy to relate. Definitely gives you that warm feeling afterward. Good afternoon! I'm looking for a movie recommendation, something to get my mind off of the current status of our country. I love comedies and since laughter is the best medicine, I'd like to find a family friendly comedy to lift my spirits."

It's an old, kinda stupid movie I haven't watched many chick flicks, but I have had friends who said that Pitch Perfect is a great one. Hi What's the last one that you've watched?

I am glad you have a plan for the night now. Would you like to watch this Trailer? Actually that would be very helpful, if you don't mind. Thanks!

I just got done watching Contagion last night. What kind of movies and stuff do you watch? I can't say I blame you about the superhero thing they have kind of beaten that one into the ground. I am glad you like Sci-FI! I do too! Have you ever seen I am Legend with Will Smith? I thought it was really well done and loved Will Smith and his struggle with being alone and trying to deal with his own depression while trying to survive it all! You got it! Also, What was the last thing you saw Will Smith in aside from this movie you are going to watch tonight? Hello how are you doing today? Hey I think I can actually send this trailer to you if you would like? Perfect, thanks! I would have to say the latest release of Bad Boys with Martin Lawrence. I can't remember if the name is Bad Boys 3 or a spinoff name like Bad Boys Reloaded - Also I wanted to see him in Gemini Man but never did. Have you heard how that movie is or seen it? Of course mate. Please enjoy it I have seen it like 5 times or more haha. It'll absolutely hold your attention and Mr. Smith is awesome.

677,"['Saoirse Ronan', 'Lady Bird', 'Marriage Story']"," yes! I love it when it keeps me engaged and wanting to know what is next!

He also makes great music videos. SO movie that reminds me somewhat of Polar (what I've heard of it) that I thought was excellant is Atomic Blonde, starring Charlize Theron and James McAvoy. It takes place in Berlin during the cold war revolving around double agents. It's great. Great action scenes, intriguing story line, great music seleciton and cinematography.

It's about a Leprechaun who has his gold stolen and is on a murderous mission to get it back! It also stars Jennifer Aniston and has many comedic moments. I've seen about half of it. Pretty funny, same characters. Need to finish it I agree. I've been watching a lot of movies lately so I could use recommendations. Oh, I didn't know that. Thank you for the recommendation, I'll be watching that soon. Goon on Netflix is a low-budget comedy movie about a hockey player. It did very poorly at the box office but it's now a cult classic. That sounds interesting, what was it about? That's a good one, I saw that a while back. I thought it was pretty good but I could see why the ratings wouldn't be great. I still haven't seen the second one. That's true. I'm always looking for new things to watch. Are there any other movies you would suggest? Cool, I'll have to watch that. I enjoy all kinds of movies. Thanks again. i can imagine Hi, I really liked watching the movie The Leprechaun on St. Patrick's Day.

What did you like about it? Well here, Historical films can feel really immersive when they are good. It's cool to imagine living in a different time.

I want something more new-age. Oh, ok yeah. Was that released this year? Ocean's 11. I like heist films a lot, and there was some comedy, but I wanted something newer and more funny Mad Max: Fury Road is a stark contrast from what we've been discussing but I like to think that this movie has one of the strongest female leads, although the film features Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron is a secondary lead who shows a bit of her acting chops in this non-stop action movie. I saw it three times when it was in theatres. Hi there, I'd like to know what kind of movies you've recently been watching and what you've been in the mood for I think ensemble movies!

It was a few years back, 2015 release. But yeah, be sure to check Baby Driver out and Man from U.N.C.L.E., the trailer for Baby Driver will be coming up!

Ah so nothing from like, the 60s or 70s? Are you more into hard-hitting action like John Wick as well or more ensemble movies like Ocean's?

728,"['Jumanji: The Next Level', 'jumanji', 'Jumanji']"," I havent seen it. I lost interest after the last one Paul Walker was in :( No kidding! I thought you're supposed to get smaller with age, that guy just bulks up more and more i like both it don't matter old or new for me it all depends on the story how it will interest me I just rewatched one of his older movies the other day and he looks like a baby compared to now oh yea i watched all his movies and i even knew him way before he starts to film movies i knew him he was in WWF oh yeah kevin hart is something different but when i see them act together they really match in comedy compering to others u see them mix with rolls not yet I'm waiting for the right time to watch I'm available lol lol its amazing but the being in the field of acting really matches him lot better It actually sparked some curiosity. I have that movie on to must watch list.

730,"['Brad Pitt', 'Criminal', 'Morgan Freeman', 'Emma Watson', 'The Lodge', 'Regression', 'comedy', 'The Prodigy', 'Serial']"," Just started Castle Rock yesterday and I was glued. It has a great plot. Its one of those movies that has a good spiritual message but still has the modern day internet users as part of the story. It has lots of blood and gore. Beware. Prodigy is actually a Hulu tv show. It's a bit like Criminal Minds but the star is the son of a famous serial killer. There's another movie that looks kinteresting called Se7en. It's loaded with stars like Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Serial killings based on the 7 deadly sins What are some that you've seen and really liked? I recommend a great movie called The Cleansing Hour. It has a twist to it. good morning, I really like mysteries and horror movies but I stay open minded to new movies Good morning. Can I help with a movie selection? Sounds like some good movies. I'm gonna look these up and watch this week. There are several movies called Prodigy. Which one? Yikes. The Lodge looks interesting. Mixes horror with some comedy so you can sleep at night. I loved the Malevolence movies. I have not started the Castle Rock yet. I've been watching the Prodigy and a Handmaiden's tale I've watched Malevolence 3 and currently watching a series called Castle Rock. That's brand new. Looks interesting. This sound great. I've heard of this movie before. I like to laugh during movies also. As long as its not to silly. Yes Se7en sounds like my type of movie. Gonna watch this one today. I am a fan of crime investigations and serial killer documentaries as well. Great. Me too."
