50," Hello! How are you doing today? I am doing well, thanks. How are you doing? I am doing great, thank you for asking! I am here to help recommend a movie for you. What kind of movie and movie trailers do you like to watch? I really enjoy comedies, nothing too cheesy though. I feel that, sometimes cheesy movies feel like they're trying to hard to be funny. What's that last good movie that you watched? It can include a movie you watched at home or at the theater. I watched Wine Country with Amy Poehler. That was pretty funny, but a little girly for my tastes. Oooh, I haven't seen that one, I'll have to check it out! Are you interested in seeing a movie that's similar to Wine Country, or something different- perhaps less girly? I'd prefer something less girly, so no rom coms. Okay, got it! What's your favorite comedy movie? Of all time? I really like Airplane, or anything with Leslie Neilsen. That's an awesome movie, so many great one liner jokes. Leslie had such great comedic timing. Yes, he's a classic. I think Will Ferrell is a lot like him. Both have that comedic presense. ",Anchorman

I'll know which one to not recommend based on that. 1984 is my exact favorite book actually... As for the King movies IT (Both the 90's one and the remake), Cat's Eye (I think that was him), Pet Cemetery one and two (From back in the day)... Gosh it's been awhile. Gerald's Game. There were a few others but they were all years ago. Fun fact: He used to due the Stan Lee thing where he stuck himself into the movies as a cameo. ",The Shining

Otherwise there's Sonic and Bad Boys for Life. I'll take a look at both of those. If we do decide to stay home, is there a romantic comedy that you recommend? If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested. The classics are always a nice switch. Tell me about it! Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved. Awww. That actually sounds perfect! Even if we see something in the theater, I'm definitely taking this recommendation. Thank you so much for your help! ",Overboard

Psycho is one of my favorites as well. What is the last movie you watched? I just watched Jojo Rabbit and absolutely loved it! Have you seen any other of Taika Waititi's movies? I have seen most of them, he is one of my favorite filmmakers. I really liked his movie What We Do in the Shadows, did you see that one? I did! I loved the move and the TV show they adapted from it. I love quirky comedies like that. I know you have a lot of different tastes in movie genres, are you looking for a quirky comedy, horror, or thriller? I love all of those genres, but would prefer quirky comedy. Okay. How do you feel about musicals? Musicals are not my favorite unless they are a little more offbeat like Moulin Rouge was. Have you ever heard of a movie with some singing in it called The Producers? I have seen The Producers (both the original and the remake), it was okay but for comedy I would prefer something that is not a musical. Okay. Have you seen some other satirical comedies like The Interview, Tropic Thunder or Sorry to Bother You? I have not seen Sorry to Bother You, but heard it was good. I do want to see that movie. Would you like to watch the trailer for it? I have seen it before and it does look like a good movie. Have you seen Dr. Strangelove? I have, but it has been a long time. What about Monty Python's Life of Bryan? I love Monty Python movies and I have seen all of those. If you know of a farce comedy like that I would be into it. You are quite the movie enthusiast! Have you seen Robin Hood Men in Tights? Haha, yes I've seen a lot. I do love Robin Hood Men in Tights and I think all of Mel Brooks' other movies. Great comedian! Are you a fan of horror comedies too like Shaun of the Dead? Yes, I love horror comedy. Shaun of the Dead is one of my top 10 movies. ",Zombeavers

167," hello there how are you today?? Hello. I'm good, how are you/ Living the dream one day at a time! Excellent. I'm looking for a movie trailer. I really love action movies. Do you have any recommendations? Well currently if you want to go to the movie theater you could see the new star wars film. rise of skywalker. It is really good and will keep you on you seats edge for the whole movie. but if you are looking to stay in and rent or stream a good movie i would go with terminator dark fury or fast and furious hobbs and shaw. both of these movies are very good and will keep you well entertained . I'm definitely interested in the Terminator franchise. I'll go with that pick. You will not regret it ! it has the return of the original Sarah Conner ( well the lady who played her in the very first movie, Linda Hamilton i believe is her name), as well as Arnold as the terminator that has aged thru time who has stayed to make sure things stay on track for the human race and sky net never rises. plus the new terminators are awesome!!! the graphics and effects are next level for sure Is her son in this version of the movie as well? (The co-star of Terminator 2) yes he is, i didnt wanna spoil it!! How do they address ageing the terminator? Seems like an odd thing for robots to do. ",Genesis

177," Hello there! How are you doing this morning? Okay. I'm kinda bored, though... Part of me wants to go watch a movie. Got any recommendations? For sure! What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw? My tastes are pretty varied, but I tend to prefer stuff with a decent amount of action or a good sense of humor. Not outright comedies, just funny movies. For example, the last movie I saw in theaters, if I'm remembering correctly, was Knives Out a couple months back. That was pretty funny. ",Star Wars

Not outright comedies, just funny movies. For example, the last movie I saw in theaters, if I'm remembering correctly, was Knives Out a couple months back. That was pretty funny. I absolutely loved Knives Out. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest Star Wars film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself. Knives Out was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together... I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind. I have heard really good things about Looper, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it... What're the other two like? ",Detective Story
