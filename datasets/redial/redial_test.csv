2000,"Hi there how are you? Hello, I am doing well! Thank you. I'm wanting to find out all of the hype with these comic book movies. Where do i start? What genres do you like I heard they are all tied together like Thor and Iron Man (2008) are on the same team or something Yes, exactly and they all are a twist on real human adventures Most are bad science experiments gone wrong. But Batman movies like The Dark Knight (2008) isn't a part of that? I like both movies that you mentioned Thor Then when you bring the The Avengers (2012) into it I get confused haha. Okay I'll watch Thor Haha well luckily if you watch each movie they do really stand alone. Good to know lol thank you for your help DC vs Marvel is such a weird world! The Avengers (2012) are all apart of the same world with individual problems with their gifts That is a good point of view you make. I did not think to mention the different brands of comics Do the Avengers hang out with Iron Man (2008) and those guys? I'm thinking Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) !!! LOL im sorry Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) is more like Star Wars (1977) okay I see. Thank you for explaining. Whenever I try to keep up my boyfriend gets so annoyed. I basically have to wiki everything The stories of the Universe verses galaxy and worlds. I love them all. They are very entertaining its good to know they are all separate. have a good one!

I like comedy and action especially Inception (2010) Have you seen any of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy ( Shaun of the Dead (2004), Hot Fuzz (2007), The World's End (2013) )? They're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre tributes with tight cinematography and a delightful wit, directed by the person behind Baby Driver (2017) . They're quite British, but are otherwise extremely distinct and, despite not being connected in terms of story, feel like a cohesive series. (they also have running gags throughout, some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a punchline you'd almost forget) I haven’t but I will add them to my list for sure ! Any other films you like in particular? I usually watch American films In that case, I can just recommend the aforementioned Baby Driver (2017), a fun and tightly-choreographed action film packed with wit, a heist film where almost everything is in sync with the music. Is it on Netflix ?! I'm not sure, but I can check not at this point, unfortunately Ahhh dang no worries I’m sure I will be able to find it somewhere even the video store ! ",Paprika

Any recommendations for me? ",The Happening
3549,"Hello. What kind of movies do you like? I like dramas and westerns. Dramas like The Help (2011)? I've never seen that, but I like movies like Whiplash (2014) and Inception (2010) Oh. I've never seen those. What about Remember the Titans (2000)? Haven't seen that either, sorry. Inception is by Christopher Nolan. Have you seen any other Christopher Nolan movies, like The Dark Knight (2008) or Dunkirk (2017) Nope. But I am familiar with Interstellar (2014). I like science fiction movies like that. Any recommendations for me? The Happening (2008) and Species (1995). Also Jurassic Park (1993). Good choices. Did you see Jurassic World (2015) Yes I have. I assume you liked it. I didn't. I didn't see it! I heard it wasn't good. My favorite Jurassic Park movie is the second one. I've only seen the first one. I should probably watch them though ",Independence Day

Whats one of your favs? Seen Law Abiding Citizen (2009). The Usual Suspects (1995) sounds similar. :) Ok cool I like The Boxtrolls (2014), Rush Hour (1998), and Life (1996) just to name a few. Awesome. Hope you choose one of these to enjoy. I might check out a few of them myself I'm feeling childish, so I think I will check out Shrek (2001). There's not too many fart jokes in it, is it?

Very entertaining You should check out Borat (2006) if you like comedy movies Thanks I'll check it out I guess I sorta like superhero films no matter how tacky they are. Avengers: Infinity War (2018) was good too That makes sense. Have you seen Kick-Ass (2010) by any chance Its not a traditional super-hero movie but its still considered one and its great I loved that movie. I do think I liked it because of the approach it took to the superhero thing as well Its been a while since I've seen it I might just rewatch it tonight ",Watchmen
